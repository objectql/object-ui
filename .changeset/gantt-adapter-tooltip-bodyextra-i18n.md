fix: pass full gantt config to renderer, render multi-value lookups in gantt tooltips, persist `bodyExtra` on dataSource actions, and complete zh/en gantt labels

Four platform gaps that the EHR app previously worked around with `node_modules` patches:

- **app-shell / ObjectView** — the `config.gantt → renderer props` adapter was a hardcoded 6-field whitelist, so `parentField`/`typeField` (and `baseline*`, `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `tooltipFields`, `quickFilters`, …) never reached the renderer and the chart degraded to a flat list. It now spreads the full `viewDef.gantt` first, then applies the three required defaults last (mirroring the gallery branch).
- **plugin-gantt / ObjectGantt** — the tooltip value formatter only handled single-object lookups, so a multi-value lookup (a populated `[{name},{name}]` array) fell through to `'—'`. It now maps each array element to its display value and joins them.
- **app-shell / useConsoleActionRuntime** — `bodyExtra` was merged only on the absolute-HTTP path; the generic `dataSource.update` path ignored it, so a pure-confirmation action (no params array) left an empty payload and persisted nothing. `bodyExtra` is now merged last on that path too, matching the documented semantics.
- **i18n** — added the gantt labels the 9.x renderer references but the bundles lacked: `toolbar.thisWeek/thisMonth/exportPdf/saveLayout`, `viewMode.year`, `menu.add*/removeDependency/noCandidates`, the `linkType.*` and `conflict.*` blocks, and `readOnly*` — in both `en` (canonical key source) and `zh`.
