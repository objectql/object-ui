fix(console): three real-user console failures — 403 blamed on the network, ⌘K search capped at 8 objects, nav gating fields inert

1. **List error panel classifies the failure** (`plugin-list`, `i18n`): a 403/401 from the data source used to render the same "check your connection" copy as a genuine outage, sending users to debug their network while the server was correctly denying access. The panel now classifies by `httpStatus`/`status`/`statusCode`, the `PERMISSION_DENIED`/`UNAUTHORIZED` error codes, or an `HTTP <status>` message prefix, and renders dedicated permission-denied / sign-in-required copy (all nine locales).

2. **⌘K / full-page search scope is no longer truncated** (`react`): `maxObjectsQueried` caps the per-object fanout fallback, not the search scope — it used to slice the candidate pool itself, so the `objects` whitelist sent to the platform's `/api/v1/search` only ever named the first 8 nav objects. Which sidebar group came first decided which records were findable; everything later in the nav was unsearchable no matter what the user typed.

3. **Nav gating fields finally gate** (`app-shell`): `evaluateVisibility` only evaluated `${…}` template strings, so the `{ dialect: 'cel', source }` envelopes the spec normalizes every authored `visible` predicate into fell through to a blanket "visible" — a constant-false predicate still rendered for everyone. It now delegates to `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateCondition`, which routes CEL envelopes to the canonical `@objectstack/formula` engine. And the sidebars' `requiredPermissions` check treats a bare name as an ADR-0066 system capability (union of the user's permission-set `systemPermissions` from `/me/permissions`) — the same subset rule the server applies to `AppSchema.requiredPermissions` — instead of misreading it as `can(<name>, 'read')`, which had degraded `requiredPermissions` into a hide-from-everyone switch (admins included). The `object:action` form and the legacy object-read fallback keep working.
