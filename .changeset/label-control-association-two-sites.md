Associate the label with its control at the two form surfaces where the two were never programmatically connected (objectui#3341 — found while implementing #3299/PR #3340, and deliberately left out of that PR's scope fence as a different class of defect).

`aria-required` reaching the control (#3299) only fixes the required *state*; at these two sites the control's accessible *name* was still wrong, because the label pointed at nothing:

- `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `InlineCreateRelated`'s create-tab fields rendered a `<label>` with no `htmlFor` beside an `<Input>` with no `id`, and the two were siblings rather than wrapper/child. The field label was unreachable for assistive tech, and clicking the label did not focus the input. The ids are namespaced with `React.useId`, because `field.name` alone is unique only within one instance and a detail page mounts one of these per related list.
- `@object-ui/components` — the custom `ActionParamDialog`'s `select` branch rendered `<Label htmlFor={param.name}>` but never put the matching `id` on its Radix `SelectTrigger`, so the reference dangled. The textarea / number / date / text branches already set `id={param.name}`; select was the only one that did not.

`SelectTrigger` renders a `<button role="combobox">`, and `button` is a labelable element, so the plain `htmlFor`/`id` pair is the correct association there — no `aria-labelledby` required. No spec change and no widget-props contract change.
