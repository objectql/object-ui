A dataset dimension on a dotted relationship path now renders its option labels instead of the raw stored enum

A `DatasetDimension` whose `field` is a relationship path (`crm_account.industry`) got no select-option resolution at all: the chart plotted `education`, `finance`, `manufacturing` — the database column, unresolved — while the **same underlying field** reached as a **local** dimension rendered `Education`, `Finance`, `Manufacturing` beside it on the same dashboard. Nothing errored, so the widget just quietly showed database enum values to end users; on a non-English deployment those are words that appear nowhere else in the UI, since every form and list shows the translated label.

The label lookup read options as `baseObject.fields[<path>]`, which only ever matches the local spelling. For a dotted path the options live on the **related** object, so the lookup missed and the renderer fell through to the stored value.

The object-resolution step of that one lookup now walks the path: each segment before the last must be a declared relationship (`lookup` / `master_detail`, target read from `reference` / `reference_to` / `referenceTo` / `reference_to_object`), and the terminal field's options are read off the object that actually owns it. This is the same lookup for both spellings rather than a dotted-path variant beside it — a single-segment path never enters the walk and resolves exactly as before, so the local and joined paths cannot drift apart. Multi-hop paths (`crm_account.owner.department`) resolve too, which is the shape the dataset designer already emits.

Hops ride the caller's existing `GET /meta/object/:name` channel — the same authenticated read that fetched the base object — so no new fetch layer is introduced, and objects are fetched once per resolution even when several dimensions share a prefix. Every failure stays best-effort: a segment that is not a relationship, a target that cannot be loaded, or a terminal field with no options yields no mapping and the raw value survives, exactly as it does today.

Applies to both surfaces that carried this lookup: dashboard dataset widgets (`DatasetWidget`) and the chart view's dataset path (`ObjectChart`).

Scope: this ends at "the label is in hand". Whether that label then passes through the i18n bundle is a separate gap tracked upstream as objectstack#5076.
