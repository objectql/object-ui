`TextAreaField`'s character counter now announces itself in the session locale. The counter block — rendered only when the field declares `maxLength` — carried the accessible name `Character count: {n} of {max}` as an English literal, and the element is an `aria-live="polite"` region, so a zh/ja/ar session had that English sentence read out on every keystroke while sighted users saw only the language-independent `{n}/{max}` digits. Nothing was wrong on screen, which is why it survived: only screen reader users could perceive it (#3406).

Unlike #3404, no key existed to consume — none of the ten locale packs had any character-count string. `fields.textarea.characterCount` is new in all ten, interpolating `{{count}}` and `{{max}}` as one sentence rather than parts assembled in code, because `ja` and `ko` put the cap before the count ("of {{max}} characters, {{count}}"), an order no concatenation can produce. The English pack value and the `FIELD_DEFAULTS` fallback are byte-identical to the literal they replace, so an `en` session and a provider-less embed both render exactly what they did before.

Behaviour is unchanged: `aria-live="polite"` and the per-keystroke recompute are deliberately untouched here and tracked separately (#3408).
