A dashboard date filter's default has one spelling again — the bare preset name — and the `{ preset }` object becomes a documented legacy alias with a retirement window

`@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6 added a cross-field refinement to `GlobalFilterSchema` holding a `type: 'date'` filter's `defaultValue` to three spellings: a preset NAME (`last_7_days`), an ISO date (`2026-01-15`), or a date-macro token (`{today}`). objectui's derived schema had widened `defaultValue` to `z.any()` and did not carry the refinement, so it accepted `{ preset: 'last_7_days' }` — metadata the platform refuses. That is the tolerant-consumer shape where the designer goes green and the save fails server-side, and it is now closed: the refinement is adopted, the widening is retired, and the object form is refused with the spec's own message.

Per the maintainer ruling on objectui#4165, the spec stays strict and the bare preset name is the single canonical spelling. `{ preset }` is handled as an ADR-0089 legacy alias rather than by a permanently tolerant schema: `liftLegacyGlobalFilterDefault` / `liftLegacyDashboardFilterDefaults` (new exports on `@object-ui/types`) convert it to the bare name, `@object-ui/core`'s `resolveDashboardFilterDefs` applies the lift when it reads a stored dashboard, and the console's dashboard designer applies it as the document enters the editable draft so the next save persists the canonical spelling. The retirement window is recorded at the read site: the alias may be removed in `@object-ui/types` 18.0.0, and every lift warns on the console so a surviving legacy document is visible rather than silently tolerated.

No stored dashboard has to change for this release. The lift means a document carrying the object form keeps loading and rendering exactly as before — measured, not assumed: a legacy declaration already resolved correctly, because `{ preset }` also happens to be the runtime value shape objectui's own date filters use, and that coincidence is why the object form went unnoticed for so long. What changes is that the declaration is now canonicalized on read and rewritten on save, so the two spellings converge instead of accreting.

The other two divergences in this schema — the bare-string `options` shorthand and the optional `optionsFrom.labelField` — are unaffected. Carrying the spec's refinement while keeping them needed a new composition: a refined object schema in zod 4 rejects `.extend()` and `.omit()` outright and types every `.safeExtend()` override as `never`, so objectui's schema now spreads the spec's shape and re-attaches the spec's object-level rules by delegating to the spec schema itself. Nothing restates the spec's grammar, and a refinement the spec adds later flows in with no change here.
