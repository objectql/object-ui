Import wizard: use registered server-side import mappings (framework #2611). When an object has `mapping` metadata artifacts targeting it, the wizard shows a "Saved mapping" selector; picking one hands rename + transforms + write semantics to the server (the artifact is authoritative), replaces the manual column table with a read-only summary of the mapping, and submits `mappingName` over source-header rows (mutually exclusive with the inline column rename). `ImportRequestOptions` gains `mappingName`; the objectstack adapter gains `listImportMappings(objectName)` (feature-detected — the selector simply doesn't appear when unsupported). New `grid.import.*` strings added across all locales.
