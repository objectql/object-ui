Analytics surfaces now run resolved select-option labels through the locale bundle — the chart legend and the related list on one page stop disagreeing

A dashboard widget grouped by a `select` field rendered the option's authored English label while the related list beside it rendered the translation. The decisive evidence in objectui#4030 is the stored value `orion`: the chart read `Orion Engineered Carbons`, a string with no resemblance to the value and matching the object's `label` byte for byte. So the analytics path had already RESOLVED the option label — it simply never ran the result through the i18n bundle before display. (`domestic → Domestic` differs from its value by case alone, which is why the first diagnosis, "the report groups by stored value", was wrong.)

There is exactly one resolution channel and this change reuses it rather than adding a chart-side dialect: `fieldOptionLabel` from `useObjectLabel`, i.e. `{ns}.fieldOptions.<object>.<field>.<value>` — the convention `@objectstack/spec` names objectui as the reader of, and the one list, form, kanban and record-picker surfaces already translate select options through. The bundle is applied ONCE, at the output of the label net that landed in objectui#4053/#4263, on the shared option list every consumer reads: chart axis and legend, the table/pivot cells of a dotted dimension, that table's CSV export, per-category colours and the declared category order. `@object-ui/core` gains `localizeFieldOptions` (the pure mirror of `translateOptions`), an optional translator on `buildDimensionLabelMap`, and `resolveDimensionFieldMeta` — the same single relationship walk `resolveDimensionFieldOptions` performs, now keeping the object that OWNS the terminal field, because for `crm_account.industry` the bundle key is `crm_account`, not the dataset's base object.

Two properties the fix is shaped around. The rows reach this net keyed either way — by stored value when the server did not resolve the dimension, by the English label when it did (ADR-0021) — and the reported screen is the second case, so the map answers to both keys and lands on the same translated display. And identity is untouched: `relabelDimensions` still rewrites display only, so a drilled chart segment clicked as `欧励隆` filters by `orion`, bucket ids and pivot totals keep their raw keys, and an option with no bundle entry (or an `en` console) renders exactly the authored label it renders today.

The per-locale work moved from the metadata fetch into the render, so switching language now re-labels in place instead of waiting for a refetch.

Not covered, and unchanged here: a LOCAL select dimension on a table/pivot, whose label the server resolves and whose client-side net is deliberately off (objectui#4263), and a dashboard global filter's own field label, which has no object name in its metadata to key a bundle lookup with — tracked on objectui#4030.
