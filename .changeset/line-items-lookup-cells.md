Lookup cells in line-item grids. `LineItemsField` columns now support `type: 'lookup'` (with `reference` / `displayField` / `idField`), rendering a real lookup picker per cell that resolves display labels and stores the foreign-key id — so master-detail line grids can reference other objects (category, account, assignee, …) instead of only plain selects.
