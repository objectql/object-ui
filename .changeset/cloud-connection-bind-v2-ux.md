Cloud Connection bind v2 UX (cloud ADR runtime-identity-binding §2.3): the binding flow becomes one click. `CloudConnectionPanel` drops the environment-id input entirely (registration happens cloud-side at approval), auto-opens the approval page in a popup on Connect (user-code display stays as the popup-blocked fallback), and shows the registered runtime name + runtime id once bound. `DeviceAuthPage` displays the requesting device's context (`runtime_name` / `runtime_version` from the verification URL) plus an "only approve if you started this" warning — the informed-consent surface for the RFC 8628 flow. Two new `auth.device.*` keys across all locales.
