`record:highlights` now honours a `readonly: true` on an authored field entry, so a header chip for a platform-owned column no longer offers inline edit. `HeaderHighlight`'s editability gate already consulted `field.readonly`, but the renderer rebuilt each entry from a fixed `{name,label,icon,type}` list and dropped `readonly` one layer before that check, so the gate could never fire from authored metadata — a hook-maintained rollup or approval-written grade could be overwritten by hand from the detail-page header strip and stayed wrong until an unrelated write re-fired the computation. `readonly` is now a declared key on `HighlightField` and on the `RecordHighlightsComponentProps.fields[]` entry union, mirroring `DetailViewField.readonly` (objectstack#5077).
