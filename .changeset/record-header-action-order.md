Record-header actions honour `Action.order`, so approval decisions no longer get buried in the `⋯` overflow menu (objectui#2339 / framework#2670).

The `action:bar` renderer now stable-sorts its actions by an explicit **`order`** field (lower = higher / more prominent, default `0`) before the inline/overflow split. The sort is stable and treats unset `order` as `0`, so action groups where nobody sets `order` keep their exact registration order — existing toolbars are unaffected. `order` is added to `ActionSchema` in `@object-ui/types`, mirroring `Action.order` in `@objectstack/spec`.

`RecordDetailView` now assigns the injected **Approve / Reject** decision buttons a strongly-negative `order` (and gives Approve the highlighted `primary` variant), so on a pending-approval record the approver's decision takes the primary-button slot and app `record_header` actions follow it — instead of the app having to hide its own actions to surface the decision.
