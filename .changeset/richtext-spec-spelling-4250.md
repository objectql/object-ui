`richtext` fields are placed like the long-form fields they are — four layout sets stopped spelling the type three ways the spec rejects

`@objectstack/spec` spells the WYSIWYG type `richtext`, one word, and **rejects** `rich_text` and `rich-text`: both exist only as typo keys in the spec's own `suggestFieldType` table, so `FieldSchema` refuses a field declared with either. Four sets that place fields by matching the RAW type string carried nothing else — `SKIP_TYPES` in the related list spelled it `rich_text`, both `WIDE_FIELD_TYPES` and `SECONDARY_FIELD_TYPES` spelled it `rich-text` — so each set was inert for the only spelling a producer can emit, and every one of them named the type it was failing to handle.

For a real `richtext` field that meant: it was auto-derived into a related-list column, it never spanned the full row in a multi-column detail section or form (unlike `markdown` and `html` sitting right beside it in the same sets), and it stayed in the dense primary section of the record page instead of dropping into "More details". All four move together — half of them would have left the detail page and the form disagreeing about the same field, which is worse than the uniform gap.

The dead spellings are dropped rather than kept alongside the live one: the alias table is the single place aliases belong, and a set that carries both invites the next drift. The pins are derived from the spec's own `FieldType` vocabulary instead of enumerated, so a member that stops being a real type name fails by name — replacing an assertion that was green only because the set contained the string it asked about.

`markdown` joins `richtext` and `html` in the related list's `SKIP_TYPES`, on a measurement rather than on the assumption that it renders raw. It does not: markdown and richtext both render through `MarkdownCellRenderer`, formatted and sanitized. The reason none of the three works in a table is that the formatted output is block-level — a heading, paragraphs, a list — inside a single-line truncating cell, so a document shows as one clipped heading with the rest invisible. `textarea` stays derived for the same reason read the other way: it renders as plain truncated text, which is a useful column. Author-declared columns are untouched — this set only filters the zero-config auto-derive walk.
