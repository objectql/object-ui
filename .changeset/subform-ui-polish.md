Master-detail entry: lighter layout, compact lookup cells, persisted line order.

- **De-framed line-item section** — the subform no longer double-frames the grid in a `Card` (border + `p-6`); it renders as a light label + the grid's own bordered table, reclaiming the width the line table needs.
- **Compact lookup cells** — `LookupField` gains a `compact` mode (used by grid cells): the selected value shows inline in a borderless single-line trigger instead of a chip stacked above a separate "Select…" button.
- **Persisted drag-reorder** — `deriveMasterDetail` detects a sort field (`position`/`sort_order`/…), excludes it from the editable columns/row-form, and threads it as the grid's `sort_field` so reordering stamps `row[position] = index` and survives a reload.
