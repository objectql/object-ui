The bulk selection bar now applies the ADR-0066 D4 `requiredPermissions` capability gate, and short-circuits a boolean `visible` instead of treating it as a broken expression (#3492).

Two independent gaps put the selection bar out of step with the other three action surfaces. **First**, the capability gate: `action-bar.tsx` (list toolbar), `containers.tsx` (record header) and `RowActionMenu.tsx` (row kebab) all call `useCapabilityGate`, but `resolveBulkActions` dropped `requiredPermissions` when promoting an object action into a `BulkActionDef` and `BulkActionBar` never read it — so the same action was hidden from an unentitled user in the row kebab and offered to them in the selection bar the moment they ticked a checkbox. For a `type: 'api'` action pointed at a custom endpoint nothing behind it was guaranteed to say no. `BulkActionDef` now carries `requiredPermissions?: string[]`, the fold forwards it, and the bar filters on it with the engine's rule verbatim (empty declaration passes, several are AND-ed, unknown capabilities fail OPEN).

**Second**, boolean `visible`: `partitionBulkRows` handed it straight to the CEL engine, producing `{ dialect: 'cel', source: undefined }` — a fault, which on this fail-closed path disqualified every selected record. So `visible: true` hid the button from everyone, the exact inverse of what it says; and `visible: false` rendered the button anyway, because the render guard tested `def.visible &&` for truthiness and read a declared `false` as "ungated". Booleans now short-circuit the way `useCondition` / `useRowPredicate` always have, and "is this def gated" is one shared predicate (`hasVisibilityGate`) rather than a truthiness test. `BulkActionDefSchema.visible` is `ExpressionInputSchema`, so `objectstack build` never emitted this shape — hand-written view JSON and in-process callers did.
