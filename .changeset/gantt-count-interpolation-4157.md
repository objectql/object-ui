The gantt's conflict dialog shows the number of affected tasks again, not a literal `{2}`

`gantt.conflict.body` was resolved at the render site with a literal string replace on **single** braces — `t('gantt.conflict.body').replace('{count}', String(n))` — while all ten locale packs spell the placeholder the i18next way, `{{count}}`. `"…{{count}}…".replace("{count}", "2")` consumes the inner seven characters and leaves the outer pair behind, so every user on every loaded pack read "自动重新排程 **{2}** 个受影响的任务？". The dialog now interpolates through i18next (`t('gantt.conflict.body', { count })`), the idiom `gantt.delete.body` already used.

The two sibling keys three lines away in the same file, `gantt.autoScheduleDlg.body` and `.skipped`, were **not** broken — pack and call site both used single braces, and they rendered correctly. They are converted anyway, because that split is the whole mechanism: two write-confirmation dialogs in one component carried two different interpolation idioms, so `conflict.body` drifting to the i18next spelling in the packs (which is the correct spelling, and matches every other placeholder in the bundle) silently broke the render. Leaving the auto-schedule keys on the literal-replace idiom leaves the same trap armed for the next translator. All ten packs and the plugin's bundled English fallback table now agree on `{{count}}` for all three; only the braces moved, no translation was reworded.

`gantt.quickFilter.resultSummary` stays deliberately single-brace — its `ObjectGantt` call site really does resolve `{shown}`/`{total}` with a literal replace, and that convention is pinned by its own parity test. It is now the only key in the gantt namespace on that idiom, and the comments at both spellings say so.

Nothing caught this, and each gate was silent for its own reason: the cross-pack parity check compares en against each pack, and all eleven spellings agreed; the en-drift check compares a pack against its own history, and the packs were born matching. Both are **relative** comparisons, and the defect lived in the **absolute** relationship between a pack's spelling and the syntax the call site resolves. The existing render test asserted the dialog body contains `'1'` — which `{1}` satisfies. The new pin asserts the absolute form directly, under a real loaded pack, for every way a placeholder can survive to the screen.
