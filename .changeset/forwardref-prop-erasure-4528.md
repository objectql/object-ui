`DashboardRenderer` and `ListView` serve the props they declare — the index signature stops erasing them

Both components declared a full props interface and neither was enforced. A `[key: string]: any` on `DashboardRendererProps` and `ListViewProps` puts `string` into `keyof Props`, so `'ref' extends keyof Props` is always true and React's `PropsWithoutRef` takes its `Omit` branch — and `Omit` over a type carrying a string index signature keeps only the index signature. Every declared property was dropped from the resolved type, on both sides: the render function received `{ [x: string]: any }` (so even `schema` was `any` inside the component), and every JSX call site was unchecked. Measured on the pre-fix source, `keyof ComponentProps<typeof DashboardRenderer>` was `string | number` and `ComponentProps<typeof DashboardRenderer>['onWidgetClick']` was `any`, while the interface went on declaring `(widgetId: string | null) => void`. `ListView` measured identically for `onRowClick`. This is objectui#4422 / PR #4438's trap in the two packages that issue left unswept.

Graded **minor, not major**: the interfaces have always DECLARED these props; the index signature erased them from the resolved type. Restoring what the interface documents is a FIX to the published contract, not a contract break — no documented capability is removed, and `any`-typed accidental passthrough was never the documented surface. Nothing in either package's README or docs endorses relying on it.

The props each component genuinely reads but never declared are now declared by name, at the type each one lands on: `dataSource` on both, plus `onAddRecord` / `onBulkAction` / `onPageSizeChange` / `onEdit` / `onDelete` / `onBulkDelete` on `ListView`. `DashboardRenderer`'s DOM pass-through keys are derived from `toDomProps`' whitelist constant itself, so the declaration and the runtime filter cannot drift — the "declare it and forward it by name" direction `@object-ui/core`'s `dom-props` doctrine asks for, rather than reopening the spread.

Type-only: the emitted JS for both packages is byte-identical before and after (verified by sha256 on `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.umd.cjs`), and both packages' runtime suites are untouched and green.

Three latent defects the erasure had been hiding are fixed with it, each surfaced by the repo-wide type-check: `DashboardWithConfig` typed its widget-select handler `(widgetId: string)` while `DashboardRenderer` calls `onWidgetClick(null)` to deselect; `InterfaceListPage` built a list schema whose `viewType` was a bare `string`; and `StudioDesignSurface` forwarded a `refreshKey` prop that no component in the chain declares or reads, so it was silently dropped. Per-package structural guards now pin the shape in both packages, covering the public `forwardRef` that takes its props whole — the spelling objectui#4438's `schema`-destructuring scan could not see.
