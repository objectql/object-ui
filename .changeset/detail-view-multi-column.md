Align the DetailView column density with the entry form (objectui#2578 "多列显示").

- **Detail views now reach up to 4 columns, matching the form.** `inferDetailColumns` was hard-capped at 2 columns and the section column count was derived per-section, so a field-heavy record displayed 2 columns in detail but 4 in the edit form. It now uses the same density scale as the form's `inferColumns` (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 by field count) and `deriveFieldGroupDetailSections` derives the count from the object's *total* field count and stamps it uniformly on every section — so view and edit read at the same width. The responsive grid classes and `getResponsiveSpanClass` ladder were extended through the 3- and 4-column breakpoints, and the effective column count is clamped to the number of visible fields so a lone field never sits at 1/N width.
- **Long JSON values no longer spill into the neighbouring column.** `JsonCellRenderer` (used by `address`/`json`/`object`/`composite`/`record` fields) applied `truncate` to a bare inline `<span>`, where `overflow:hidden`/`text-overflow:ellipsis` never clip (there is no width box) and the accompanying `white-space:nowrap` also defeated the cell's `break-words`; a long name-keyed map or address JSON therefore overflowed into the adjacent GPS/color cell once the grid narrowed to multi-column. The renderer is now a `block max-w-full` element so `truncate` clamps to the cell width (full value still on hover), and the detail cell wrappers carry `min-w-0` so unbreakable values wrap instead of setting the track's min width.
