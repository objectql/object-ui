/**
 * ObjectUI — network-escape guard (objectui#6640)
 *
 * Makes a test that reaches a REAL socket a NAMED, RED test instead of an
 * anonymous stack on stderr.
 *
 * ## The class this closes
 *
 * happy-dom's DEFAULT document URL is `http://localhost:3000` — nothing in this
 * repo configures it. So any DOM-env test that renders a component reaching one
 * of the ~18 `apiFetch ?? fetch` / `globalThis.fetch` fallbacks in product code
 * resolves a relative `/api/v1/...` against a real TCP socket, and prints:
 *
 *     Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000
 *         at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (node:net:1637:16)
 *
 * That stack has NO `stderr | FILE > TESTNAME` header and NO user stack frame —
 * it is an unhandled socket error raised below the layer Vitest captures per
 * test, so Vitest cannot tie it to a file. THE ANONYMITY IS THE DEFECT, not the
 * noise: it is why this class was fixed four times (objectui#5225 / #3339 /
 * #4106 / #4688, all still intact on main) and still reproduced in 12 of 16
 * green shards. Each fix closed the files someone had listed by hand, and the
 * output never said who was left. A measured sweep of every project found 21
 * emitting files across 9 packages, none of them a file those four cards fixed.
 *
 * ## Why enforcement is in `afterEach` and NOT a throwing `fetch`
 *
 * The obvious instrument — make the escaping `fetch` reject loudly — DOES NOT
 * WORK HERE, and would have shipped a guard that never fires. Every one of
 * these call sites already tolerates failure by construction:
 *
 *     const doFetch = apiFetch ?? fetch;
 *     try { ... } catch { /* best-effort: leaves the rows as the server sent *\/ }
 *
 * That tolerance is exactly why the suite is GREEN while escaping. A throw from
 * inside `fetch` lands in that same `catch` and is swallowed, leaving the test
 * green and the guard silent. So the escape is RECORDED at the call and
 * ASSERTED in `afterEach`, where no product `catch` can reach it.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * It does not silence anything: the real request still goes out and the real
 * ECONNREFUSED still prints, because those stacks are the evidence that a test
 * reached for a socket (objectui#6640 ruling). It adds attribution beside them.
 * It skips and quarantines nothing — every test still runs and asserts exactly
 * what it asserted before.
 *
 * ## The burn-down list is GONE — it reached zero (objectui#7307)
 *
 * There is no `KNOWN_ESCAPES` set here any more, and adding one back is the one
 * change this file exists to make hard. It used to hold what REMAINED of the 21
 * files measured escaping on `67dadd6`; objectui#7307 burned them down batch by
 * batch (PRs #7999, #8013, #8019, #8032, #8053) and the sixth and last batch
 * emptied it — `FlowNodeInspector.specKeys.test.tsx` now serves its
 * `/api/v1/meta/object` probe from a double like the rest. A ledger that reaches
 * zero has to be RETIRED, not left as an empty list a future red can be made
 * green by joining: an empty allowlist is one line away from a populated one,
 * and its own pin said so ("delete the guard's KNOWN_ESCAPES machinery and this
 * pin together, rather than leaving a pin that asserts nothing"). So the set,
 * the attributed-stderr branch that kept listed files green, and the
 * known/unknown split all went with it, together with the reconcile pin in
 * `scripts/__tests__/network-escape-ledger.test.ts` — which now pins the
 * ABSENCE of that machinery, so re-introducing a list is red rather than
 * routine.
 *
 * What that leaves is the STANDING guard, which is the whole of objectui#6640
 * and is not part of the burn-down: the recording `fetch` wrapper below, and the
 * `afterEach` that fails ANY escape in ANY file. Every escape is now unknown,
 * every escape is red on its first run, and the remedy is the `Fix:` text at the
 * bottom of this file — serve the probe from a double.

// No `node:*` imports, no `process` typings and no `import.meta.dirname` here,
// deliberately: `tsconfig.vitest-setup.json` — the gate that compiles this file
// — ships NO `@types/node` on purpose (it documents the measurement: adding it
// costs 12 errors inside third-party declarations). Anything below that needs a
// Node value must declare its own structural type rather than import one, so the
// gate stays green without weakening it for the other root setup files.

/**
 * This file sits at the repo root, so its own directory IS the repo root.
 *
 * Derived by STRING SURGERY on `import.meta.url`, not with `new URL('.',
 * import.meta.url)`: Vite statically rewrites that exact pattern at transform
 * time, and the value that survives into the run is `/@fs/...`, not a real path.
 * Measured — it silently turned every path relative-isation into a miss, which
 * failed all 21 known escapes at once.
