/**
 * ObjectUI ESLint rule: no-unprefixed-query-params
 *
 * Sibling of `no-query-params-under-options`, for the other half of the same
 * defect class: a query option written WITHOUT its `$`, at the TOP level of a
 * `find`/`findOne` params object — `find(obj, { top: 200 })` instead of
 * `find(obj, { $top: 200 })`.
 *
 * `QueryParams` (`packages/types/src/data.ts`) declares every query option with
 * a leading `$` — `$select`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skip`, `$top`, `$expand`,
 * `$search`, `$searchFields`, `$count` — and `convertQueryParams` in
 * `@object-ui/data-objectstack` builds its outgoing options by copying exactly
 * those. An unprefixed key reaches no branch and is dropped: no throw, no
 * warning. `QueryParams` also carries `[key: string]: any`, so the type system
 * accepts both spellings equally and nothing rejects the dead one.
 *
 * The consequence for a dropped cap is an UNBOUNDED read, not a truncated one.
 * The platform's GET list route has no default page size — the pinned
 * `@objectstack/client` serializes `top` only when the caller supplied it
 * (`if (normalizedOptions.top != null)`) — so an absent `top` returns the whole
 * match set. The symptom is therefore invisible until the object is large, and
 * when it appears it reads as a data problem rather than a code problem.
 *
 * Three live sites existed when this rule landed (objectui#5458):
 *
 *  - `app-shell` `ObjectView.tsx` — `find(name, { limit: 0 })` for the footer's
 *    record count. `$top: 0` is honoured end to end as "no records", so the
 *    dropped key did not merely widen the read, it INVERTED the call: "count
 *    only, fetch nothing" became "fetch every row in the object", on every
 *    mount and every refresh of every list view.
 *  - `app-shell` `metadata-admin/AssignedUsersSection.tsx` — `{ $filter: {…},
 *    limit: 1 }`, one line away from three correct calls (`$top: 500`, `$top:
 *    200`, `$top: 1000`). Half-correct spelling in a single object literal is
 *    the shape a reviewer's eye slides over, which is the argument for
 *    mechanising this rather than reviewing it.
 *  - `apps/console` `sdui-workbench-preview.tsx` — `{ top: 200 }`, inside a
 *    template literal holding runtime page metadata. See the boundary note
 *    below: this rule does NOT catch that one, and cannot.
 *
 * A FOURTH site, which the card that commissioned this rule never named, was
 * found by the rule itself on its first repo-wide run: `plugin-dashboard`
 * `DashboardFilterBar.tsx` passed `fields` AND `top` in the same literal, so a
 * dashboard filter's option list read every row and every column of its source
 * object while its own comment described it as capped at 200. That is the
 * argument for the rule in one site: two dropped keys, in one call, under a
 * comment asserting the opposite.
 *
 * ## Scope, deliberately narrow so it discriminates
 *
 * Two independent narrowings, both load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Only a KNOWN query-option name.** Not "any unprefixed key". The index
 *     signature exists because adapters legitimately take adapter-specific
 *     params, so flagging every unprefixed key would report the shape the type
 *     was written to allow — and a rule that cries wolf gets switched off. The
 *     list below is closed and every entry maps to a real `QueryParams` key.
 *  2. **Only the second argument of a `find`/`findOne` CALL.** Unlike its
 *     sibling — whose `options`-holding-a-`$`-key signature is unmistakable
 *     anywhere — every name on the list (`top`, `limit`, `filter`, `sort`,
 *     `select`, `count`, …) is a perfectly ordinary object key elsewhere in
 *     this repo. Outside a finder call the name carries no signal at all, so
 *     the call is what makes the report meaningful.
 *
 * `Array.prototype.find` is a `.find(` member call too. It is excluded by its
 * own signature rather than by naming: its first argument is a predicate, so a
 * call whose first argument is a function literal is skipped. The key list is a
 * second, independent filter — an array `find`'s optional second argument is a
 * `thisArg`, which is not an object literal carrying `top`/`limit`.
 *
 * Only STATIC key names report — an identifier or a string literal. A computed
 * key (`{ [k]: v }`) cannot be judged without running the code and a spread
 * (`{ ...params }`) hides its keys, so neither says anything. Same rule as the
 * sibling, same reason: null always means "say nothing".
 *
 * ## Known boundaries, recorded rather than silently omitted
 *
 *  - **Source inside a string is invisible to it.** `sdui-workbench-preview.tsx`
 *    holds its page source in a template literal, which the parser sees as one
 *    `TemplateLiteral` token and never as a `CallExpression`. No AST rule can
 *    reach it. That site was fixed by hand for objectui#5458; a text scan is
 *    the only mechanism that would gate it, and a text scan over this key list
 *    would match the prose in this very file.
 *  - **Only these spellings.** `orderBy` (camelCase) and `pageSize` are the
 *    same mistake in spirit and are deliberately NOT listed: no site has ever
 *    used them here, and the argument for this rule is that it discriminates.
 *    Add one when a real instance appears, with the instance cited — which is
 *    exactly how `fields` got on the list. It is not a `$`-less `$fields` (no
 *    such key exists); it is an alias for `$select`, the same kind of entry as
 *    `limit` -> `$top` and `offset` -> `$skip`, and it earned its place on a
 *    live site: `plugin-dashboard` `DashboardFilterBar.tsx` passed `fields` and
 *    `top` in ONE literal, so the filter-option query fetched every row and
 *    every column of the source object.
 *
 * No autofixer. `limit` and `offset` do not rename to `$limit`/`$offset` — they
 * rename to `$top`/`$skip` — and `filters` collapses to `$filter`, so a fix
 * would have to merge into a key that may already be present in the same
 * literal. More importantly `ObjectView`'s `limit: 0` needed a judgement about
 * what the call MEANT before it could be rewritten; a fixer would have made
 * that silently. objectui#5458.
