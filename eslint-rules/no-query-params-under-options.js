/**
 * ObjectUI ESLint rule: no-query-params-under-options
 *
 * Bans `$`-prefixed query keys nested under an `options` key —
 * `find(obj, { options: { $top: 100 } })` instead of `find(obj, { $top: 100 })`.
 *
 * `QueryParams` (`packages/types/src/data.ts`) declares `$top`/`$skip`/
 * `$filter`/`$orderby`/`$select`/`$expand`/`$search` at the TOP level, and
 * `options` is not one of its keys. No adapter in this repo reads
 * `params.options` — `convertQueryParams` in `@object-ui/data-objectstack` and
 * `ApiDataSource` both read `params.$top` — so a cap written under `options`
 * never reaches the wire and the query silently runs unbounded.
 *
 * Nothing else catches this. `QueryParams` carries `[key: string]: any`, which
 * is deliberate (adapters accept adapter-specific params) but means the type
 * system accepts both spellings equally: `{ options: { $top: 100 } }`
 * type-checks exactly as well as `{ $top: 100 }`, and the two mean completely
 * different things — the first means nothing at all.
 *
 * Two live instances existed, written by different people at different times:
 *
 *  - `object-timeline` — the whole fetch was
 *    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })` (fixed in objectui#4009 /
 *    objectstack#7137).
 *  - `object-kanban` — `$filter` at the top level, the cap under `options`, so
 *    a board over a large object fetched every row the server would return for
 *    as long as the block existed (fixed for objectui#4025).
 *
 * That is the reason this is mechanical rather than a review item: the shape
 * reads as a deliberate grouping ("query options"), it type-checks, it
 * publishes, and the symptom (too many rows) looks like a data problem rather
 * than a code problem — so a review catches it once and then misses the next
 * one. Error level, at write time: the editor squiggle interrupts at the moment
 * the grouping is typed, which is where both authors made the mistake.
 * objectui#4734.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow so it discriminates rather than blanket-matches
 * (measured on the repo at the time of writing: 47 object literals carry an
 * `options` object property, and NOT ONE of them holds a `$`-prefixed key —
 * `options: { data }`, `options: { kanban, calendar }`, `options: { sortBy,
 * limit }` and so on are all normal and must stay silent):
 *
 *  - Only a `$`-prefixed key makes it a hit. `options` on its own is a
 *    perfectly good key in this repo and always will be.
 *  - Only STATIC key names — an identifier or a string literal. A computed key
 *    (`{ [k]: v }`) cannot be judged without running the code, and a spread
 *    (`{ ...params }`) hides its keys, so neither reports.
 *  - Only an object-literal `options` property whose initializer is itself an
 *    object literal. Prose gets this for free: every remaining textual match in
 *    the repo is a comment or a test header describing the history, and an AST
 *    rule never sees those.
 *
 * A known and deliberate boundary: the rule does not look at what the object
 * is passed to, so a data field literally named `options` filtered with a
 * Mongo-style operator (`$filter: { options: { $in: [...] } }`) would report.
 * No such site exists in the repo — the census above found none — so the rule
 * is not narrowed for it. If one ever appears, the narrowing that fits is
 * "skip when the `options` property sits inside a `$`-prefixed property's
 * value", which loses nothing real: nobody writes the dead spelling inside a
 * filter.
 *
 * No autofixer on purpose. Hoisting the keys means merging them into the
 * enclosing object, which can collide with a key already there (kanban had a
 * top-level `$filter` beside the dead `options`), and dropping the now-empty
 * wrapper is only safe when it held nothing else. Both are judgement calls.
 *
