/**
 * `/studio/*` is an ENTRY gate, and this file pins the entry decision BOTH ways.
 *
 * ## The measured defect
 *
 * On a composed hosted-SaaS shape the Studio nav tile is deliberately absent and
 * every metadata write is refused, yet typing `/_console/studio/` rendered the
 * full pillar builder — Data / Automations / Interfaces / Access, Publish and
 * Save draft visible — to a plain tenant principal, who was walked through the
 * entire "new package" form and only refused at submit (`POST /api/v1/packages`
 * → 403). The lockdown criterion is two-part (UI entry hidden AND API refused);
 * the backend half is green, and what stood on this side was a WRITE-level gate
 * where an ENTRY-level one belongs.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why in this shape
 *
 * The REAL subtree. `studioRoutes` is the element `App.tsx` drops into its
 * `<Routes>`, so nothing here is a transcription of the route tree — a
 * transcription would be free to agree with itself while `App.tsx` quietly
 * mounted the builder ungated.
 *
 * The two builder components are the only stubs, and they are SPIES: the
 * assertion for a non-holder is that `BuilderLanding` / `StudioDesignSurface`
 * were never CALLED, which is strictly stronger than "their DOM is absent" —
 * a component that never mounts cannot render an authoring affordance, a
 * Publish button, or fire the metadata reads behind them. `AuthGuard`,
 * `ProtectedRoute`, the router and the gate itself are all real.
 *
 * Both directions are pinned on purpose: a gate that refused EVERYONE would
 * pass the non-holder assertion, so the holder case is a control, not a
 * courtesy. So is the loading window — that is where a fail-open bug hides,
 * because "not yet loaded" is the state a route gate is most tempted to read
 * as permission.
