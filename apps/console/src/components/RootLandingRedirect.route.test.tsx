/**
 * objectui#4233 — the ENTRY PATH into `/`, not the landing policy.
 *
 * `RootLandingRedirect.test.ts` pins `resolveLandingPath` as a pure function
 * and stays green no matter how badly the entry path behaves — which is
 * precisely why the live bug survived it. QA reported four cold sign-ins
 * landing on `/_console/home` with an `isDefault: true` app published, while
 * the same navigation from an ALREADY-AUTHENTICATED session landed correctly.
 * A policy test cannot see that gap: the policy is handed a list, and the
 * defect is about which list it is handed and who gets to bake its answer into
 * the URL.
 *
 * So this file renders the REAL `/` route element — `ProtectedRoute` (the real
 * `AuthGuard` composition and the real `LoginRedirect`) wrapping the real
 * `RootLandingRedirect` — against the two things that vary underneath it: the
 * auth verdict and the app-list load status. Only `@object-ui/app-shell`'s
 * chrome and the `useMetadata` value are stubbed; the redirect logic under test
 * is imported, never transcribed.
 *
 * ## Two doors, one principle
 *
 * The QA chain had two amplifying stages, and they were closed by two different
 * changes:
 *
 *   1. The pre-auth door. On the vendored console QA ran (objectui `09987b68`,
 *      2026-08-09) `/` mounted as `<ConnectedShell><RootLandingRedirect /></…>`
 *      with NO guard above it, so an unauthenticated visitor DID run the
 *      resolver against a list emptied by a 401, `Navigate`d to `/home`, and the
 *      guard on `/home` then captured that already-wrong path into
 *      `?redirect=%2Fhome`. objectui#4042 (commit `41d602274`, 2026-08-10 —
 *      one day after that build, one day before the card was filed) wrapped `/`
 *      in `ProtectedRoute`, which closes it: an unauthenticated visitor to `/`
 *      never mounts the resolver, and `LoginRedirect` declines to capture the
 *      bare `/`. The `cold sign-in` cases below are the regression guard for
 *      that door — they are GREEN on `main` before this change, and they are in
 *      this file because nothing else pins them.
 *
 *   2. The post-auth door, still open, and what this card actually fixes. The
 *      guard only proves a SESSION resolved; it does not prove `GET /meta/app`
 *      succeeded. When that fetch fails behind a valid session (server restart,
 *      5xx, a request that raced a session refresh), `ensureType` catches and
 *      resolves `[]`, `loading` goes false, and the resolver reports "no
 *      default app" about a deployment it never managed to ask — then fossilizes
 *      it, because `Navigate … replace` rewrites `/` to `/home` and a reload
 *      re-enters at `/home`. `app fetch failed` below is the red-first case.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (predicted, then run — RUN, and the count corrected)
 *
 * Predicted: reverting the gate (`if (loading) return <LoadingFallback />`,
 * `unresolved` computed but unread) turns the two CONCLUSION cases red and
 * leaves everything else green. Measured: **three** red — 11 passed / 3 failed.
 * The third is `re-asks the metadata layer exactly once`, and it goes red for a
 * mechanism worth writing down rather than papering over: without the gate the
 * component `Navigate`s away on its first render, unmounts, and the effect
 * cleanup clears the pending timer, so the re-ask never fires. The retry is not
 * an independent behaviour bolted on beside the gate — it is only reachable
 * BECAUSE the gate keeps the component mounted. One fix, one seam, three pins.
 *
 * Every other case stayed green, which is the property that matters: the
 * cold-sign-in and deep-link cases cannot go red for this change's reason, so
 * they remain independent evidence that door 1 is still shut.
