/**
 * ONE description of the form CONTAINER contracts, in this app — objectui#5596.
 *
 * ## The class this pins shut
 *
 * `FormPage.fieldSpec.test.ts` next door pins the LEAF: the element type of this
 * app's authored-field array is `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `FormFieldSpec`, not a
 * local twin of it (objectui#5542). The two containers ABOVE that leaf were
 * still hand-declared here — `FormViewSpec` and `FormSectionSpec`, the same
 * names app-shell declares — and unlike the leaf they had already drifted in
 * both directions, so neither copy was a subset of the other:
 *
 *   FormSectionSpec  app-shell declared `description` / `visibleWhen` /
 *                    `visibleOn`; this file declared none of them. This file's
 *                    `columns` admitted the string arm; app-shell's did not.
 *   FormViewSpec     this file declared `label` / `groups` / `sharing` /
 *                    `submitBehavior`; app-shell stopped at `type` + `sections`.
 *
 * Both are now the shared declaration, and the shared declaration is derived
 * from `@objectstack/spec` rather than restated — so the question "what may an
 * author write in a form section?" has one answer, and that answer is the
 * contract's.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and by which tool
 *
 *   • **`tsc`** — {@link formContainerContractPins}. Type assertions are erased
 *     at runtime, so vitest proves nothing about them; the app's `type-check`
 *     script (`tsc --noEmit`, whose `include` is `["src", "dev"]` and therefore
 *     compiles this file) is what judges them. PIN A and PIN B are the ones that
 *     close the class: they read both container types back out of the
 *     **exported** `buildSections` signature, so a re-inlined local copy fails
 *     here even if it agrees on every key on the day it is written. PIN C is
 *     their liveness control.
 *   • **vitest** — the `buildSections` block. It proves the widening is inert at
 *     runtime: a section carrying the keys this app could not previously declare
 *     builds the same rows, and the string `columns` arm — which this app's type
 *     always admitted and app-shell's always refused — still normalises to the
 *     same number.
 *
 * `RenderableSection`, what `buildSections` EMITS, is deliberately still a
 * different and narrower type: see PIN F. Keeping the incoming-document type
 * wide and the honoured-row type narrow is objectui#5542's distinction, and
 * declaring a key here is not honouring it — objectui#5627 tracks the section
 * predicates this convergence makes declarable but does not evaluate.
