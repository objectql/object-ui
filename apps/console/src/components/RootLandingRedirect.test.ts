  // ── objectui#4048 — Setup is not a "one-app deployment" ──────────────
  //
  // A new builder arriving on a just-created environment (platform SSO, no
  // explicit target) landed on Setup's System Overview — an audit/health
  // dashboard reading all zeros, because a fresh environment HAS no audit
  // history. The chain, measured end to end:
  //
  //   `/` → RootLandingRedirect → resolveLandingPath([setup])
  //       → rule 2 "single visible app" → `/apps/setup`
  //       → AppContent.resolveLandingRoute() → first nav item
  //       → `dashboard/system_overview`
  //
  // Rule 2 is right — a one-app PRODUCT deployment shouldn't have to click
  // through a one-tile launcher (#2027). Setup is not that app: it is the
  // platform administration console shipped by @objectstack/platform-objects
  // into every deployment, so "the only app I can see is Setup" means "this
  // environment has no product apps yet", not "Setup is the product". Under
  // ADR-0075 the environment layer's home is the environment's own
  // responsibility, and `/home` — build-with-AI, start-from-a-template, Your
  // apps — is that home.
