/**
 * `/setup` is a stable deep link into platform administration, and still the
 * first-run wizard on a deployment that has no owner yet (objectui#2794).
 *
 * ## The premise, re-measured at this tip
 *
 * The card reported `/_console/setup` bouncing back to `/_console/home`. The
 * route was never missing — it was OCCUPIED. `App.tsx` mounted the first-run
 * owner-bootstrap wizard there (`pages/auth/SetupPage`, ported from the retired
 * Account SPA), and that page evicts everyone it is not for:
 *
 *   SetupPage.tsx  `if (user && !submitting) window.location.assign('/')`
 *   SetupPage.tsx  `if (bootstrapped === true && !user) navigate('/login', …)`
 *
 * So a signed-in admin opening the deep link was sent to `/`, which
 * `RootLandingRedirect.resolveLandingPath()` resolves to `/home` on any
 * multi-app deployment with no `isDefault` app — the card's exact observation,
 * and a full-page `location.assign`, which is why it read as "被重定向回 home"
 * rather than as a routing error. The unauthenticated half was defective too, in
 * a quieter way: it reached `/login` with no `?redirect=`, so signing in dropped
 * the deep link on the floor.
 *
 * ## What is asserted here
 *
 * The chain, not the screen. `/` in the harness below is wired to the REAL
 * `resolveLandingPath` over a multi-app metadata list, so `/home` is a place the
 * router can actually settle on — "never lands on home" is then an assertion
 * about a reachable destination rather than about a stub that was never wired.
 *
 * `SetupPage` and `ConnectedShell` are stubbed: this file measures ROUTING (which
 * surface `/setup` resolves to, and which URL results), not the wizard's form or
 * the shell's provider stack. `AuthGuard` and `LoginRedirect` are REAL — the
 * `?redirect=` contract is one of the things under test, and a transcription of
 * it would be free to agree with itself.
