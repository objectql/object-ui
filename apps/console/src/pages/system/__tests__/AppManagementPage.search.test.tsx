/**
 * objectui#4343 — the Applications page's SEARCH filter reads the same fields
 * the rows render, and must read them the same way.
 *
 * Filed out of #4307 (PR #4344), which keyed this page's chrome and introduced
 * the `appTitle` helper the rows name an app by. The filter one screen above it
 * was left on a raw read:
 *
 *     (app.label || '').toLowerCase().includes(q)
 *
 * `label` and `description` are `I18nLabel` in `AppSchema` — `string |
 * Record<string, string>` in `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6 — so a non-string
 * label is spec-legal metadata. An object is TRUTHY, so `|| ''` never fired for
 * one and `.toLowerCase()` got the object:
 *
 *     TypeError: (l || "").toLowerCase is not a function
 *
 * thrown inside `filter` during render, which takes the page out instead of
 * degrading search — and only once someone types, because `if (!searchQuery)
 * return true` short-circuits the empty case.
 *
 * ## What these cases pin, and why the mock answers in a real language
 *
 * The sister i18n file mocks `t` to answer in no natural language at all, which
 * is right for proving the chrome asks the pack. It cannot ask THIS file's
 * question, though: search is judged by what an operator can SEE, so the pack
 * here answers with real words that deliberately share no substring with the
 * call site's own `defaultValue` (`app.crm.label` -> `Vertrieb`, never `CRM`).
 * That makes every keyed case two-sided — the resolved text matches, and the
 * authoring `defaultValue` does NOT — which is what pins the `t` argument
 * rather than merely pinning that some resolver was called.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted before running)
 *
 * Restoring the two raw reads turns the keyed and map cases RED **by the
 * TypeError above**, thrown on the first keystroke, and leaves the plain-string
 * control GREEN — that asymmetry is the whole claim, and it is why the control
 * case is here at all. It is also why `toThrow`-style coverage would be
 * worthless: the defect is not "something throws", it is that one truthy shape
 * reaches a string method.
 *
 * ⚠️ The prediction was wrong the first time, and the reason is worth keeping.
 * Four cases were expected red; three came back red. The filter is a chain of
 * `||`, so **a query the NAME already satisfies short-circuits before the label
 * is read** — the map case searched `mapped` against `mapped_app` and passed on
 * the UNFIXED page, having never reached the throwing term. Every red-first
 * case in this file therefore hands the filter a query no earlier term can
 * answer (`vertr`, `crm`, `kunden` against `sales_app`; `zzz` against
 * everything). A case that matches on the name is testing the name.
