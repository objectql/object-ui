/**
 * Approvals Inbox — the record link is offered only to a viewer who can open it
 * (objectui#5211).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Approver routing goes by position; record visibility is a separate gate, and
 * nothing reconciles the two. An approver routed a request about a record they
 * cannot read was still offered the row's record chip, which landed on the
 * record page's "Record not found — … does not exist or may have been deleted".
 * Per the maintainer's ruling (2026-08-19) the link is suppressed for exactly
 * those rows.
 *
 * ## What each case is measuring
 *
 * - the unreadable row renders **no link** (and still renders the title, which
 *   comes from the request's payload snapshot);
 * - the readable row is untouched — link, and the same href as before;
 * - the whole page costs **one** readability read for two rows of one object —
 *   the batching the ruling made the deciding criterion;
 * - the **decision path is untouched**: one case pins inline approve WITHOUT
 *   involving the probe (so it holds on the pre-change tree too — that is what
 *   makes it a pin), and one shows that a row whose link was suppressed is still
 *   decidable, which is the thing that already worked and must keep working.
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing here asserts anything about the server answering `404` rather than
 * `403` for the by-id read. That is the server's deliberate choice and is out of
 * scope in both directions; the probe issues a list read, never a by-id one.
 *
 * No build artifact sits between the edit and this test: the root Vitest config
 * aliases every `@object-ui` specifier at that package's `src` directory, and
 * the page and probe under test are this app's own source. (Writing that path
 * with a glob segment would close this comment — the sequence is a block-comment
 * terminator, and the parse error it produces points at a line far below.)
