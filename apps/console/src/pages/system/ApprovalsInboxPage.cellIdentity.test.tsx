/**
 * Approvals Inbox — the row cells survive a re-render instead of being
 * remounted (objectui#5348).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `RequestCell`, `RecordCell` and `InlineActions` were declared INSIDE
 * `ApprovalsInboxPage`'s own body. React identifies a component by the identity
 * of its function, so every render produced three brand-new component *types*
 * and React unmounted and remounted each row's subtree rather than updating it.
 * The page re-renders on a 60s interval (the `now` clock at the top of the
 * page) whether or not anybody is touching it, so this fired on a timer rather
 * than at some rare edge.
 *
 * ## What these cases assert — and what they deliberately do NOT
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing here asserts where the three functions are *declared*. A placement
 * assertion ("they sit at module scope now") stays green for a refactor that
 * moves these three and introduces a fourth inline component beside them, and
 * it says nothing about whether a remount actually stopped. These cases assert
 * the observable consequence instead:
 *
 *  1. **Identity** — the DOM nodes the three cells rendered are the SAME node
 *     objects after a re-render. A remount cannot pass this: React drops the
 *     old subtree and builds fresh elements, so every node is a new object.
 *     Asserted for all three cells in one pass, so fixing one and leaving
 *     another inline fails.
 *  2. **Subtree state** — focus inside a row survives the clock tick. That is
 *     the "remounting discards transient state" half of the card, and it is
 *     what a real user loses.
 *  3. **The measured symptom** — an Approve click whose pointer sequence spans
 *     a re-render still opens the confirmation. This is the swallowed click
 *     objectui#5211 hit and worked around at the call site; here it is made
 *     deterministic by landing the minute tick BETWEEN the press and the
 *     release rather than hoping the scheduler puts one there.
 *
 * Case 1 is the mechanism and case 3 is the symptom. Both are kept because
 * neither implies the other: the mechanism can be repaired for one cell and
 * left broken for another, and a symptom that reproduces only under a specific
 * tick interleaving is not evidence about the other two cells.
 *
 * ## Why a test rather than the lint rule
 *
 * `react-hooks/static-components` exists for exactly this class and is `error`
 * in this repo (via `reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules`, spread in
 * `eslint.config.js`). It does not cover this page. Measured on `origin/main`:
 * an arrow-form inner component injected into `ApprovalsInboxPage` and used in
 * JSX produces **zero** reports, while the same shape in a ten-line file
 * produces two — the rule's analysis bails out on this component. So these
 * cases are the only guard this page has.
