/**
 * Approvals Inbox — a DEAD record reference renders as a tombstone, never as
 * the bare record id (objectui#7108).
 *
 * ## The ruling
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-08-31 (总监席第 5 场决裁批 #5) point 2, kept in the
 * language it was ruled in: 历史终态审批单保留 + 墓碑呈现：审计行不动；呈现层把
 * 死引用渲染为「关联记录已删除」墓碑，不再退化为裸记录 id。
 *
 * ## What each case measures, and why a weaker pin would pass on worse code
 *
 * A pin asserting only "the row does not show a raw record id" passes on a row
 * that renders NOTHING — and an empty row is worse than the bare id, because
 * the approver loses the fact that an approval exists. So the cases below pin
 * the tombstone's PRESENCE, its TEXT, and that the rest of the row (flow,
 * submitter, status, submitted-at) still renders.
 *
 * A second discriminator, against the caricature that makes every reference
 * answer the same thing: a LIVE reference must still render its business
 * identifier and its link.
 *
 * And the non-regression axis, aimed at the plausible WRONG fix rather than at
 * the bug's shape: treating any failed lookup as a deletion would report a
 * deletion to a viewer whose only problem is permissions (objectstack#7345's
 * case). The fixture makes that failure mode visible — `rec_hidden` and
 * `rec_deleted` are BOTH absent from the readability probe's answer, exactly as
 * the platform's read path fuses them (existence non-disclosure) — and pins
 * that only the row the SERVER marked `record_deleted` gets a tombstone.
 *
 * ## Fixture notes
 *
 * The stubbed `listRequests` answers every tab with the same rows, as this
 * file's siblings do; the "All" tab is selected because that is where a
 * `cancelled` row actually lives (objectstack#13568 clears the approver index,
 * so a cancelled request leaves "My Pending" by construction).
 *
 * `queryAllByText` / `within(row)` throughout, never a bare `queryByText`: an
 * inbox renders each request twice (desktop table + mobile card), so the
 * tombstone string is present more than once and a bare query THROWS on the
 * multiple match rather than reporting a miss.
