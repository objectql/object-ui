 *
 * The `dataSource` input is EMITTED at the gate-wrapping seam — the mechanism,
 * pinned once, over the whole registration graph (objectui#6678).
 *
 * ## What is being pinned, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` is read by `ElementDataSourceGate` on behalf
 * of every object-bound block that wraps itself in it, and was declared by none
 * of them — so the html tier reported the one spelling that resolves a saved
 * view with the same `unknown-prop` warning it gives the spellings that do
 * nothing. The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 took option B **in the injection
 * form**: emitted mechanically at the wrapping seam, from the same place that
 * reads the key. Nine hand-kept copies across nine packages is what that ruling
 * refused, because copies drift and the tenth block forgets.
 *
 * So this file pins the MECHANISM, not a list of blocks. It never names which
 * blocks are gate-wrapped; it derives that set from the live graph and asserts a
 * property that holds of the whole set. A block added, moved between packages or
 * renamed tomorrow moves this test with it — which is the only way a pin on
 * "no drift" can itself be drift-free. Eleven packages are covered without one
 * of them appearing in this file.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here
 *
 * The claim is *package-agnostic*, so it needs the full registration graph — the
 * same pair `dev/manifest-dump.tsx` builds the published artifacts from, which
 * `public-contract.test.ts` and `registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` next door
 * already read for the same reason. A hand-assembled list would agree with
 * itself and prove nothing.
 *
 * ## The three legs, and why none of them is redundant
 *
 *  1. **Wrapping is established INDEPENDENTLY of the declaration.** A test that
 *     read the marker and then asserted the injection keyed on that marker would
 *     be checking one line against itself. So gate-wrapping is detected by
 *     RENDERING each candidate against an unresolvable saved view and looking
 *     for the gate's own DOM signature — a `data-testid` only the gate emits.
 *     That is evidence from the render path, which is the only place it exists.
 *  2. **Every wrapping registration declares the key** — the injection reached
 *     it, whichever package it came from.
 *  3. **Nothing else declares it.** The control direction, and the reason option
 *     A was refused: a fix that published `dataSource` on blocks that never read
 *     it makes the diagnostic lie the other way instead of not at all.
 *
 * Plus the consumers: the key must reach the three artifacts `inputs` feeds —
 * `sdui.manifest.json`, `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` (the JSX authoring types) and
 * `sdui-blocks.md`. Asserted through the generators themselves rather than in
 * prose, because "codegen and the designer see it" is exactly the claim that
 * cannot be taken on trust: it was false for this key for the whole life of the
 * defect.
 *
 * The `unknown-prop` half of the story — an author's actual experience, over the
 * real page path — is pinned next to the block that reports it, in
 * `packages/plugin-list/src/__tests__/htmlTierDataSourceInputDeclaration-6678.test.tsx`.
 *
 * The static half of "cannot forget" — a file that starts wrapping the gate
 * without reaching the seam — is `scripts/check-element-data-source-declaration.mjs`.
 * That gate and this one are complementary: it reads sources and cannot see the
 * registry, this reads the registry and cannot see an unmarked wrapper's source.
