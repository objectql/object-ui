 *
 * The five measured specimens of objectui#3832: a `ComponentInput` whose spec
 * type is a UNION, declared with one arm, so the repo's own manifest gate
 * reported `type-mismatch` on the OTHER arm — a legal write.
 *
 * Four of them are the inline-translation-map shapes, and they are the loud
 * ones: the input's own `description` teaches the author to write
 * `{ en, "zh-CN" }` while the same input's `type: 'string'` made
 * `sdui-parser`'s `checkType` warn about it. One platform authority, two halves,
 * contradicting each other on the write it had just recommended. The fifth is
 * `element:text_input.defaultValue`, whose spec type is `string | number`
 * (measured against `ElementTextInputPropsSchema` in
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/text-input-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`).
 *
 * The maintainer ruling (2026-08-09) picked direction (a): `ComponentInput.type`
 * learns to express unions, `checkType` passes when ANY arm matches, and these
 * five declare their real unions. This file is the user-visible acceptance face
 * of that ruling — it drives the SAME `manifestFromConfigs` + `validateTree`
 * pair the JSX-page compiler (`packages/components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx:462`)
 * and the save gate use, over the registry the console really registers.
 *
 * ## Why every specimen comes with a control
 *
 * "No diagnostic" is also what a SILENCED check looks like, and this change is
 * a widening: if `checkType` stopped reporting `type-mismatch` at all, or if the
 * array-valued `type` fell through the switch into `default: return null` (which
 * is exactly what the pre-#3832 `switch (input.type)` does when handed an
 * array), every positive assertion here would still pass. So each specimen is
 * paired with a value that matches NEITHER arm and must still be reported. That
 * pairing is what the mutation runs in the PR body key off: reverting the
 * any-arm logic alone leaves the positives GREEN (vacuously — the switch
 * swallows the array) and turns the CONTROLS red.
 *
 * Module-scope imports, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md §测试纪律): the specimens
 * resolve through registration side-effects, and paying that at import time
 * keeps it out of every test/hook timeout budget.
 *
 * ## Specimens 6 and 7 — objectui#4970
 *
 * `element:text.content` and `element:button.label` are the same shape and were
 * measured during #3832's implementation, after the ruling had already fixed its
 * scope at "the five measured specimens" — so they were filed separately rather
 * than folded in, and land here in their own `describe` below. Their arms are
 * derived from the spec's own verdicts rather than restated, which is the
 * discipline `text-input-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` adopted for the fifth
 * specimen: the gap #3832 closed is EXPRESSIVENESS, and whether a declared arm
 * matches the contract is nobody's gate (objectui#4971), so per-key derivation
 * is what stands in for one.

/**
 * objectui#5717 — `element:text_input`'s `label` / `placeholder` / `description`,
 * the trio whose declaration lagged a render site that was never behind.
 *
 * Every specimen above earned its object arm in the change that taught its
 * RENDER SITE to resolve the map: `element:record_picker.emptyText`
 * (objectui#5590) and that block's `label` / `placeholder` (objectui#5637) each
 * held `['string']` for exactly as long as their renderer dropped the map. This
 * block is the INVERSE and the reason it needed its own card:
 * `text-input.tsx` has resolved all three keys through `pickLocalized` since it
 * was written, so the map always reached the screen correctly in the viewer's
 * language — and the declaration still said `'string'`, so `validateTree`
 * reported `type-mismatch` on a legal write. Measured on `d8afbe519` before the
 * fix, through this file's own `manifestFromConfigs` + `validateTree` pair:
 *
 *     label        declaredArms="string"  ["type-mismatch :: <element:text_input> prop \"label\" expected a string"]
 *     placeholder  declaredArms="string"  ["type-mismatch :: <element:text_input> prop \"placeholder\" expected a string"]
 *     description  declaredArms="string"  ["type-mismatch :: <element:text_input> prop \"description\" expected a string"]
 *
 * ## Why this file, and not only the block's spec-parity test
 *
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/text-input-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`
 * asserts declared-arms == spec-accepted-arms per key, which is the DECLARATION
 * half. It cannot see the defect: the defect is a DIAGNOSTIC emitted by
 * `validateTree` over a manifest, and a type-level or declaration-level
 * assertion never runs that path. This file drives the same pair the JSX-page
 * compiler (`packages/components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx:462`) and the
 * save gate use, which is where the warning was actually reaching authors — so
 * without a pin here the fix could regress with every parity assertion still
 * green.
 *
 * ## Controls, and the one that is not local to this block
 *
 * Each specimen carries a value matching NEITHER arm, for the reason the #3832
 * block states: "no diagnostic" is also what a silenced check looks like. This
 * block has a second control that lives one `it` away rather than inside it —
 * `element:text_input.defaultValue` above, whose spec type is `string | number`
 * and whose `I18N_MAP` case must STILL report `type-mismatch`. That is the
 * assertion which makes this widening per-key rather than blanket, and it is on
 * the same component: had the object arm been applied to the block instead of
 * to the three keys whose contract admits it, that case is what goes green.
