/**
 * `approvals:inbox` — the component-registry key for the Approvals Inbox
 * (objectstack#7231).
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 *
 * objectstack#7213 converges the three coexisting "待我审批" entries at the
 * METADATA level: app navigation names a registry key, not a literal URL. This
 * file pins the key's three load-bearing properties, in the order a nav item
 * exercises them:
 *
 *   1. the key is registered at all, by importing the registration module the
 *      way `main.tsx` does — a side effect, next to the developer / studio /
 *      account registrations;
 *   2. `approvals:inbox` addresses `component/approvals/inbox`, so the URL the
 *      sidebar builds and the key the framework's metadata declares cannot
 *      drift apart. The URLs below are BUILT from the ref through the same
 *      helper `AppContent` uses, rather than spelled out, so a change to
 *      either one moves both;
 *   3. the page mounted through that route still sees `:appName` and
 *      `?request=<id>` — the two router inputs `ApprovalsInboxPage` reads
 *      (`useParams().appName` for record deep links, `useSearchParams()` for
 *      the notification drawer opener).
 *
 * Property 3 is the one worth measuring rather than assuming: the standalone
 * `system/approvals` route and the `component/:ns/:name/*` route are different
 * paths and only look interchangeable. They are interchangeable HERE because
 * both are relative routes under `/apps/:appName/*` (`App.tsx`), which is what
 * the last case asserts by driving the same probe down both.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does NOT assert is that `main.tsx` performs that
 * side-effect import — the one remaining way the key could be missing at
 * runtime. `apps/console`'s tsconfig ships no `@types/node`, so reading the
 * source back is not typecheckable here, and reaching for `vite/client` to
 * make it so would widen the app's type surface for a test. The import sits in
 * `main.tsx` beside its three siblings; a reviewer sees it in one line of diff.
 *
 * ## Scope of the stub
 *
 * `ApprovalsInboxPage` itself is stubbed at its module boundary. Its internals
 * (tabs, drawer, decision actions) are objectui#2762's subject and are being
 * rebuilt wholesale by objectui#2763; what belongs to THIS change is only what
 * the routing hands the page. The stub is a probe that echoes exactly those two
 * inputs, and it is mocked at the same specifier the registration lazy-imports,
 * so the entry under test is the real registered one — Suspense wrapper
 * included — not a re-creation of it.
