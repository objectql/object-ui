 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` on the html tier: the one working saved-view
 * spelling must stop being reported as a prop that does not exist
 * (objectui#6678).
 *
 * ## What was measured, and why it is worse than noise
 *
 * `dataSource={{object, view}}` is the spec's per-element data binding and the
 * ONLY spelling that resolves a saved view for an object-bound block. It works
 * — and it drew the same `unknown-prop` warning as the two spellings that do
 * nothing:
 *
 * | page source                                | diagnostic     | columns      |
 * | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
 * | `dataSource={{object:'…', view:'all'}}`     | `unknown-prop` | from the view|
 * | `viewName="all"`                            | `unknown-prop` | none         |
 * | `view="all"`                                | `unknown-prop` | none         |
 *
 * Identical reports for one key that works and two that do not, on the tier
 * meant to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract. The
 * objectui#6598 reporter tried the two that do nothing and gave up.
 *
 * ## The ruling this pins (2026-08-29, maintainer)
 *
 * Option B in the INJECTION form: the declaration is emitted mechanically at
 * the `ElementDataSourceGate` wrapping seam, so a block declares the key from
 * the same place that reads it. Option A — adding `dataSource` to
 * `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` — was refused, because that set mirrors
 * `BaseSchema` and silencing the key on blocks that do NOT read it would make
 * the diagnostic lie in the other direction.
 *
 * So this file pins BOTH directions, and the second one is the one that catches
 * the over-broad fix:
 *
 *  1. gate-wrapped block (`list-view`) — no diagnostic AND the binding still
 *     works. The columns are asserted, not just the absence of a warning: a fix
 *     that silenced the diagnostic and broke the binding would pass half of
 *     this pin and be worse than the defect.
 *  2. NON-wrapped block (`flex`, `card`) — `unknown-prop` still fires. Had
 *     `BASE_PROPS` been touched, this goes red.
 *
 * ## Why it goes through the REAL page path
 *
 * Both halves are properties of the live tier, not of a fixture: the diagnostic
 * comes from `compile()` against a manifest built the way
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx` builds it (see
 * {@link livePageManifest}), and the columns come from the real `list-view`
 * registration rendering through the real `object-grid`. A hand-written
 * manifest would agree with itself and prove nothing about what an author sees.
 *
 * It lives in `apps/console` rather than beside `plugin-list` for the reason the
 * suites next door already state: the claim is about what an AUTHOR is told, and
 * that answer is produced from the whole registration graph plus the real
 * `object-grid`. `plugin-list` depends on neither `@object-ui/sdui-parser` nor
 * `@object-ui/plugin-grid`, and taking those dependencies to host a test would
 * be the heavier change.
