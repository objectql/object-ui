/**
 * objectui#3431 — a saved view's `ViewFilterRule[]` must reach `$filter` as an
 * ObjectQL AST, not as bare rule objects.
 *
 * This is the empirical pin for the defect, run against the REAL stack because
 * only the server can answer the question the issue asked: does it accept a
 * rule array in `$filter`? It does not. Measured against the published backend
 * pair this lane pins — `OBJECTSTACK_VERSION` and `OBJECTSTACK_REF` in
 * `e2e/live/ci/backend.env`, which move together and are now held to the
 * lockfile by `scripts/__tests__/ci-cd-pipeline-doc.test.ts` (objectui#7689).
 * That pair has moved since this measurement was first taken, which is why it
 * is named by FILE and not by value: a version literal written here goes stale
 * behind the pin silently, and the whole point of objectui#7689 is that it did
 * — for two minor versions, in the pin itself. The showcase app is the one that
 * ref checks out:
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/data/showcase_task
 *     ?$filter=[{"field":"status","operator":"equals","value":"in_progress"}]
 *   -> HTTP 400 {"error":"Request failed","code":"INVALID_FILTER",...}
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/data/showcase_task?$filter=[["status","equals","in_progress"]]
 *   -> HTTP 200 {"total":2,...}
 *
 * `showcase_task.in_progress` is a SHIPPED saved view whose stored filter is
 * exactly that rule array (`src/ui/views/task.view.ts`), so no fixture setup is
 * needed — opening it is the reproduction. Before the fix the list renders no
 * rows at all (the request 400s, so `record-count-bar` never mounts); after it,
 * the 2 in-progress tasks out of 10.
 *
 * Prereqs: the usual live-e2e pair (see playwright.live.config.ts). Run:
 *   pnpm test:e2e:live e2e/live/saved-view-filter.spec.ts
 *
 * In the `test:e2e:live:ci` allowlist since objectui#3472, per live-e2e.yml's
 * promotion policy (prove flake-free first, then admit): 3/3 consecutive green
 * runs against the pinned live pair, plus a 5/5 run of the enlarged allowlist
 * to show it does not disturb the incumbent specs.
