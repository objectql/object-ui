/**
 * The report authoring face keeps the two shapes objectui#6121 relaxed — pinned
 * so a later narrowing is a red test rather than a silent re-break.
 *
 * ## Why a relaxation needs a pin at all
 *
 * Both changes below WIDEN a published type: they make authored JSON that used
 * to be a type error legal. A widening has no natural guard — every existing
 * caller still compiles, every test still passes, and nothing anywhere fails if
 * someone later "tightens" it back. A relaxation with no pin is indistinguishable
 * from an accident, in both directions and at any later date. These are the pins.
 *
 * ## What was relaxed, and the measurement behind each
 *
 * **1. `ReportComponentSchema.exportConfigs` — total `Record` -> `Partial<Record>`.**
 * A total `Record<ReportExportFormat, ReportExportConfig>` forced an author
 * configuring ONE format to declare all five. Measured on
 * `content/docs/core/report-schema.mdx`, whose three-format example failed:
 *
 *     TS2739: Type '{ pdf: …; excel: …; csv: … }' is missing the following
 *             properties from type 'Record<ReportExportFormat, ReportExportConfig>':
 *             html, json
 *
 * The runtime twin was NEVER total — `../zod/reports.zod.ts` declares
 * `exportConfigs: z.record(z.string(), ReportExportConfigSchema)`, whose keys are
 * all optional. So the TS declaration was stricter than the validator that
 * actually judges authored JSON, and this makes them agree in the direction the
 * validator already took. That asymmetry is itself pinned below (section 1c):
 * if a later change makes the MIRROR total, the two drift apart again the other
 * way and this file says so.
 *
 * **2. `ChartDataSeries.type` — declared, because the renderer already reads it.**
 * The chart example on the same page authors `type: 'line'` on a series, which
 * was `TS2353: … 'type' does not exist in type 'ChartDataSeries'`. It is not a
 * documentation slip: `normalizeChartSchema`'s `normalizeSeries`
 * (`@object-ui/plugin-charts`) reads exactly that key —
 *
 *     const family = str(raw.chartType) ?? str(raw.type);
 *     if (family === 'bar' || family === 'line' || family === 'area') …
 *
 * — so `type` is the AUTHOR spelling of the per-series family override that
 * `chartType` carries internally. The union pinned here is those three families
 * and no more: a wider union would advertise an override the normalizer drops in
 * silence (declared-but-unenforced, ADR-0049's shape).
 *
 * ⚠️ This is NOT `@objectstack/spec`'s `ChartSeries`, whose `type` is the full
 * `ChartType`. The two are deliberately separate shapes (objectstack#4115) — see
 * the `ChartDataSeries` header in `../data-display.ts`. Narrowing THIS union to
 * match the spec's would be the same mistake in reverse.
 *
 * ## Which instrument checks which assertion (stated, because they differ)
 *
 * The `Assert<Eq<…>>` lines are TYPE-level and are judged by
 * `pnpm --filter @object-ui/types type-check`, whose third leg is
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` — the project that exists precisely because
 * `tsconfig.json` excludes every `.test.ts` file. ⛔ They are NOT judged by `vitest`,
 * which strips types. That distinction is this package's own scar tissue:
 * `spec-derived-unions.test.ts` once built its whole contract on `satisfies`
 * checks that no `tsc` invocation ever read (objectstack#4074).
 *
 * The `expect(…)` lines below are RUNTIME and are judged by vitest. Every
 * relaxation therefore carries at least one assertion of each kind, so neither
 * instrument going missing can make this file vacuous on its own.
