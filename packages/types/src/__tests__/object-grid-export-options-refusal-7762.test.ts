/**
 * `ObjectGridSchema.exportOptions` is the spec's OBJECT arm, by reference, and the bare
 * format array is refused BY NAME (objectui#7762, `domain:spec` routing ruling).
 *
 * ## The defect this pins closed
 *
 * `ObjectGrid.tsx` reads `schema.exportOptions?.formats` and nothing else, and the
 * `useEffect` that warns about dropped formats reads `.formats` too and returns early when
 * it is absent. A bare format array has no `.formats`, so `['csv', 'json']` — the default —
 * won, with no error, no warning and no console line, while `!!schema.exportOptions` kept
 * the export button on screen. The mirror declared no `exportOptions` member at all, and
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so the array validated GREEN and came back verbatim.
 * Same for a retired `'pdf'` value and a sixth key: this node admitted both, where the
 * `list-view` mirror (objectui#6956) refuses them.
 *
 * The ruling: the contract REFUSES the bare array on this node, by name, with a message
 * pointing at the object shape the renderer actually reads. ⛔ NOT a fold at the renderer's
 * read site — `packages/plugin-grid/**` is untouched and its read is held to be correct.
 *
 * ## Why the object arm is PEELED rather than bound whole, and why not restated
 *
 * `SpecListViewSchema.shape.exportOptions` — what the sibling `ListViewSchema` mirror binds
 * — is a TWO-ARM union whose first arm LIFTS a bare array to `{ formats }` at parse.
 * Binding that reference here would make this mirror ACCEPT AND LIFT: the opposite of the
 * ruled refusal. So the object arm is peeled out and the lifting arm left behind. It is
 * peeled rather than restated because a local copy of the five keys is a third copy of one
 * contract, and the copy is what drifts — the lesson `objectql.ts`'s `ListViewExportOptions`
 * docblock already records for the TypeScript face.
 *
 * Identity is therefore the load-bearing assertion below: a restated copy passes every
 * verdict test on the day it is written and drifts afterwards; `toBe` cannot.
 *
 * ## Non-vacuity
 *
 * Membership is read off `.shape`, not off acceptance: the base is `.passthrough()`, so
 * acceptance cannot distinguish "declared" from "admitted unexamined" and was green before
 * the fix too. Every refusal assertion carries the live control that was green BEFORE this
 * card (the sibling `list-view` mirror still lifting the same array), so a mirror that had
 * simply stopped parsing anything could not pass this file.
