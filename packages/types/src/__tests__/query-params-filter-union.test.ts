 * objectui#3909 — `QueryParams.$filter` declares BOTH shapes the data sources
 * accept, and binds the array half to `@objectstack/spec`'s `FilterArray`
 * rather than restating it.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * The defect it pins was invisible to every runtime suite, and had to be: the
 * declaration was `Record< string, any >`, which **structurally accepts arrays**
 * (they satisfy its string index). So the two producers that have fed ObjectQL
 * AST arrays through this slot all along — `plugin-list`'s
 * `buildEffectiveFilter` (grid and export) and `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView`
 * (calendar / kanban / gallery / timeline) — type-checked, ran, and shipped
 * correct results. Nothing was broken at runtime and nothing could go red.
 *
 * The cost was paid on the type face instead, in both directions:
 *
 * 1. The type **blocked nothing while describing one legal shape as if it were
 *    the only one**. objectui#3831 is what that buys: a `Record< string, any >`
 *    slot accepted a rule array, an object spread flattened it to
 *    `{"0": {...}}`, types stayed green, and the query filtered on a column
 *    literally named `0`.
 * 2. Someone writing a new consumer reads the type and its `@example`,
 *    concludes only the record form is legal, and adds a tolerant conversion
 *    for the array path — the "widen the consumer to tolerate the producer"
 *    shape AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids.
 *
 * Both failure modes are compile-time by nature, so the pins are too. Reverting
 * `$filter` to `Record< string, any >` leaves every runtime suite green and
 * turns THIS FILE red under `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (the `type-check`
 * script) — the drift's own signature, reproduced deliberately.
 *
 * ## What is NOT pinned here
 *
 * That the union is the *authoritative* accepted set. It is not: the authority
 * is `translateFilterToAST` (`@object-ui/data-objectstack`), which enumerates
 * five input shapes. A second list here would be a third place to drift from —
 * which is exactly how two operator vocabularies came apart in #3948. The
 * binding below is to the spec's `FilterArray`, so the array half cannot fork
 * locally.
