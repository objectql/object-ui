/**
 * Every `content/docs/components/**` page that documents a schema INHERITING
 * `disabled` spells it the way `BaseSchema` declares it (objectui#7239, the
 * docs half of the objectui#7087 ruling of 2026-09-01) — `boolean | string`
 * then, `boolean | string | { dialect?: string; source: string }` since
 * objectui#7530 declared the CEL envelope on all three predicate keys (ruled
 * 2026-09-04) — the same flat spelling `button-group-doc-surface-6347.test.ts`
 * reads off the mirror, and the one that is valid TypeScript inside a `ts`
 * fence (`box.mdx`), so every page carries one spelling whatever its fence.
 *
 * ## Why a pin rather than "the docs gates went green"
 *
 * No gate can see this drift. These pages declare their own illustrative
 * `interface` blocks (objectui#6143): `check-doc-component-types` reads only the
 * `type` STRING LITERALS out of docs code blocks, and `check-doc-snippet-types`
 * compiles `ts`/`tsx` fences — a `plaintext` fence is not one. So a member row
 * in those fences may name any type at all and every gate stays green. That is
 * the same hole `button-group-doc-surface-6347.test.ts` records one page over,
 * and it is why the correction this file accompanies could not be verified by
 * running CI.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins shut
 *
 * objectui#7087 removed 18 `disabled?: boolean` narrowings from the concrete
 * schemas, so the member is now inherited from `BaseSchema` as
 * `boolean | string` — a boolean, or a predicate expression on the same
 * evaluated path as `visible`. 13 component pages went on spelling the removed
 * narrowing, teaching a type the shipped tree no longer has. A reader copying
 * those rows would conclude `disabled: "${data.status === 'locked'}"` is
 * invalid, which is exactly the capability the ruling restored.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why in this shape
 *
 *   1. INHERITED (14 rows) — the page's `disabled` row reads `boolean | string`,
 *      AND the shipped interface of the same name still extends `BaseSchema`
 *      without redeclaring `disabled`. The second half is what keeps this pin
 *      honest in the other direction: if someone re-narrows the type, the pin
 *      goes red pointing at `packages/types`, not at the page — the page would
 *      then be the thing that is right. A doc-only assertion could not tell
 *      those two worlds apart.
 *   2. INDEPENDENT (8 rows) — the item/option shapes that declare their own
 *      `disabled?: boolean` and do NOT extend `BaseSchema` still read exactly
 *      `boolean`. This is the blanket-replace control: a sweep that rewrote
 *      every `disabled?: boolean` under `content/docs/components` turns these
 *      red, and nothing else in the repo would have caught it.
 *   3. COMPLETENESS — the two tables together account for EVERY `disabled?:`
 *      row under `content/docs/components`, by measurement rather than by the
 *      counts being restated. A new page carrying the stale spelling fails here
 *      instead of sitting unclassified, which is the failure mode a
 *      hand-enumerated pin has by construction.
 *
 * ## Boundary, stated rather than implied
 *
 * The three overlay menu-item rows are doc-local names with NO shipped
 * counterpart (`ContextMenuCommandItem` / `DropdownMenuCommandItem` /
 * `MenubarCommandItem` against a shipped `MenuCommandItem`), so only their doc
 * text is asserted; that is recorded here so a later reader does not mistake
 * the missing shipped half for an oversight. `ButtonGroupSchema` is listed
 * INHERITED although objectui#6347 had already corrected its page — it is the
 * spelling all 13 others converged on, and pinning it here keeps the model row
 * from drifting away from the rows that copy it.
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the first run (red-first)
 *
 * With the 13 corrected pages reverted to their `origin/main` @ `ebc05b4d6`
 * blobs and this file in place:
 *
 *   - the 13 INHERITED cases fail, each naming its own page and the type text
 *     it actually found (`boolean`);
 *   - the `ButtonGroupSchema` INHERITED case stays green (objectui#6347 fixed
 *     that page earlier, so it is untouched by the revert);
 *   - all 8 INDEPENDENT cases stay green — the revert does not touch them;
 *   - COMPLETENESS stays green: reverting changes the type text of a row, not
 *     which rows exist.
 *
 * That last pair is the point of the control: a failure that reddened the
 * independent rows too would mean the sweep was indiscriminate, not that the
 * inherited rows were wrong.
