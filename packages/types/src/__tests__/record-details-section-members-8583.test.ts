/**
 * objectui#8583 — `RecordDetailsComponentProps.sections[]` and the
 * `@objectstack/spec` `RecordDetailsProps.sections[]` member set, both
 * directions of the divergence the card measured.
 *
 * - **item 1** — this type declares the six keys the spec declares and it used
 *   to omit: `columns`, `icon`, `description`, `showBorder`,
 *   `defaultCollapsed`, `headerColor`.
 * - **item 2** — this type no longer declares `collapsed`, the one key it
 *   declared that the spec REFUSES by name. Retired outright, no transition
 *   window (director seat, decision batch #101, applying batch #87 — this repo
 *   does not declare a key the spec refuses by name — and the 2026-08-27
 *   retirement-pacing ruling). `defaultCollapsed` is the surviving spelling.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is compile-time, and why a runtime pin alone measures nothing
 *
 * The change is a TYPE declaration. Every one of the six was already honoured
 * by the renderer — `RecordDetailsRenderer` spreads each authored section
 * through to `DetailSection`, which reads all six — and accepted by the spec's
 * parser, so nothing at runtime moves; the only layer that said no was `tsc`.
 * `vitest` strips types: the card recorded that
 * `{ sections: [{ group: 'terms', columns: 2 }] }` was GREEN under vitest on
 * the unfixed type and refused only by `type-check`. So the load-bearing half
 * of this file is what the compiler sees, and this package compiles its tests
 * through `tsconfig.test.json` — the THIRD leg of its `type-check` script
 * (`tsc --noEmit && tsc -p tsconfig.examples.json && tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`),
 * the only leg that reads this file.
 *
 * ## How the direction is proved rather than asserted
 *
 * TypeScript reports an UNUSED `@ts-expect-error` as an error (TS2578), so
 * each directive below is a claim that the instrument REFUSES something:
 * `Expect` refuses `false`, `Equal` is invariant (neither `never` nor `any`
 * reads as `true`), a key nothing declares is not a member, and an excess key
 * on a section literal does not compile. Break any of those and this file goes
 * red on the now-unused directive rather than quietly passing. Same shape as
 * `data-table-declared-keys-6882.test.ts` next door.
 *
 * ## The runtime half: the two-control probe on the INSTALLED spec
 *
 * The type is a mirror, and what it mirrors is read out of the installed
 * `@objectstack/spec` at test time, never restated: the six names must be in
 * the section object's shape; a canonical section carrying all six must parse
 * with NO issues (the parser accepts the six); and the same section plus one
 * key nobody declares must draw `unrecognized_keys` naming exactly that key
 * (the parser CAN refuse, so a refusal is about the name). Either leg alone is
 * not a reading.
