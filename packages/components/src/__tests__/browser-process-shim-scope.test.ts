/**
 * The browser `process` shim is SOURCE-ONLY — objectui#6809.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `src/global.d.ts` carried an ambient `declare const process: { env: {
 * NODE_ENV: string } }`, and `tsconfig.test.json` globs `src/**` + `/*.d.ts` in
 * for the ambient declarations its tests rely on. That project also sets
 * `"types": ["node"]`, so `@types/node` IS in the program — but the ambient
 * declaration does not AUGMENT the node global, it REPLACES it, and because
 * `@types/node` spells its module as `export = process` it also became what
 * `import process from 'node:process'` resolved to. All three obvious spellings
 * failed identically:
 *
 *     process.cwd()                                     TS2339
 *     import process from 'node:process';  process.cwd()      TS2339
 *     import nodeProcess from 'node:process'; nodeProcess.cwd()  TS2339
 *
 *     error TS2339: Property 'cwd' does not exist on type
 *                   '{ env: { NODE_ENV: string; }; }'
 *
 * Runtime was plain node in every case and all three worked — only the
 * declaration was wrong. The asymmetry is what cost real time: `packages/i18n`
 * tests read their ratchet baselines with the plain `join(process.cwd(), …)`
 * idiom, which simply did not compile one directory over.
 *
 * ## Why the shim was NOT simply deleted
 *
 * Measured before choosing (`tsc --listFiles`, both projects): the SOURCE
 * project (`tsconfig.json`, which names no `types`) contains **zero**
 * `@types/node` files, while the TEST project contains 82. Five source sites
 * read `process.env.NODE_ENV`, and an ablation — the declaration removed, the
 * source project recompiled — turned it red with five `TS2591: Cannot find name
 * 'process'` across `renderers/basic/div.tsx`, `renderers/basic/span.tsx` and
 * `renderers/form/form.tsx`. The shim is load-bearing for the source. So it was
 * NARROWED, not removed: it moved to `src/browser-process-shim.d.ts` and
 * `tsconfig.test.json` names that one file in `exclude`.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and how
 *
 * The compile-time half is THIS FILE COMPILING. `packages/components/
 * tsconfig.json` excludes tests, so `tsc --noEmit` says nothing about it —
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (the second half of the package's `type-check`
 * script) is the only thing that reads it, and `process.cwd()` below is exactly
 * the spelling that failed. Put the shim back in `global.d.ts`, or drop the
 * `exclude`, and `type-check` goes red here. That is deliberate: a runtime
 * assertion cannot see this defect at all, because at runtime all three
 * spellings always worked.
 *
 * The runtime half guards the two ways the arrangement can be dismantled while
 * still compiling: deleting the shim outright (which breaks the SOURCE build,
 * a different project than the one that reads this file) and re-adding a
 * `process` declaration to the shared `global.d.ts`.
