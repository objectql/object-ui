 *
 * `element:text_input` — `label` / `placeholder` / `description` resolve the
 * inline locale map their declaration now advertises (objectui#5717).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists when the renderer was never the broken half
 *
 * #5717 is a DECLARATION fix: the three `ComponentMeta` arms said `'string'`
 * while `text-input.tsx` had resolved all three through `pickLocalized` since it
 * was written, so the manifest gate reported `type-mismatch` on a write the
 * screen rendered correctly. Nothing in the renderer changed, and nothing here
 * was red before the fix.
 *
 * That is precisely what makes this file load-bearing rather than ceremonial.
 * `ComponentInput.type` permits an arm on two conditions — the contract accepts
 * the shape AND the renderer resolves it — and after #5717 the second condition
 * is what the declaration rests on while NOTHING pinned it for these three keys.
 * `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx` next door covers `schema.label`
 * (the BaseSchema key) on three other renderers; these are
 * `schema.properties.*` on this one, a different read path in a different file.
 * Delete the `pickLocalized` calls today and every #5717 assertion stays green:
 * the declared arms still match the contract, the gate still emits nothing, and
 * the map reaches the screen as a React child — which is the failure mode
 * `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx` measured as a THROW, not a
 * mis-render. This file is what turns that red, so the arms cannot outlive the
 * behaviour that justifies them.
 *
 * ## Why the second locale is load-bearing, not decoration
 *
 * A case that only ever asserted the ENGLISH string would pass against any
 * resolver that just reached for `.en` — including one that ignores the active
 * language entirely. The `zh-CN` cases are what separate real locale resolution
 * from an `.en` pick, which is the property `pickLocalized` has and the reason
 * the descriptions promise it.
 *
 * The renderer is invoked DIRECTLY through the registry rather than through
 * `SchemaRenderer`, for the reason `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx`
 * states: `SchemaRenderer` injects its own props around a renderer, so a test
 * driven through it can be green in both directions.
