/**
 * A lookup column whose `options` are an EMPTY array must still be FILTERABLE
 * (objectui#5031).
 *
 * objectui#4874 (PR #5030) answered the VALUE-DOMAIN question for this shape:
 * `options: []` means "the static domain is not in place", so a value on such a
 * column is never cleared against it, and the criterion was written down once,
 * as `hasStaticOptionDomain(field)` (= `options` is a NON-EMPTY array). But
 * `renderValueInput`'s remote-picker branch was still asking the same question
 * in its own words — `!field?.options` — and `[]` is truthy, so it answered the
 * opposite way: the value-domain side treated the column as remote (keep the
 * value) while the control side treated it as static (draw the option-driven
 * Select over zero options).
 *
 * The user-visible result was a column that could not be filtered at all: a
 * scalar operator drew a Select with no candidates and no search box, and
 * `in`/`notIn` drew an empty checkbox list — while the SAME column with the
 * `options` key simply absent got full remote search. The two branches now read
 * one criterion, so a `referenceTo` column with `options: []` reaches
 * {@link LookupValuePicker}.
 *
 * DIRECTIONS, predicted before running (reverse verification restores
 * `!field?.options` in the branch condition and re-runs this file):
 *
 *   - "routes an unloaded lookup column to the remote picker" — RED without the
 *     fix. Every case there asserts a picker artifact (the search box, the
 *     candidate list, the by-hand id input, the multi-value id input); on the
 *     old condition the column draws a Radix Select or a checkbox list instead
 *     and none of those artifacts exists;
 *   - "a column that owns its option domain keeps the static Select" — GREEN in
 *     both directions by design. It is the blast-radius guard: a fix that read
 *     the criterion inverted, or that sent every lookup to the remote picker,
 *     turns all of it red;
 *   - "the branch's other conditions are untouched" — GREEN in both directions
 *     too. `hasStaticOptionDomain` replaces ONE conjunct; a column with no
 *     `referenceTo` and a non-lookup type must route exactly as before, or the
 *     change widened the branch instead of correcting it.

/**
 * The columns this card distinguishes. Every one of them is the SAME lookup
 * apart from its `options` key, because that key is the whole subject:
 *
 *   - `account` — `referenceTo`, `options` ABSENT. The shape that already
 *     reached the remote picker; here as the reference behaviour the others
 *     are measured against;
 *   - `account_pending` — `referenceTo`, `options: []`. The card's column: the
 *     shape `deriveFilterFields` produces before an object's picklist values
 *     arrive, and the one that used to fall through to an empty Select;
 *   - `account_loaded` — `referenceTo` AND a NON-EMPTY `options`. A lookup whose
 *     domain really is local and complete; it must keep the static Select, or
 *     the fix has taken the static case with it;
 *   - `owner_pending` — `type: 'owner'` with `options: []` and no `referenceTo`,
 *     reached through the branch's `type === "owner"` conjunct;
 *   - `stage_pending` — a `select` (NOT lookup-like) with `options: []`. It has
 *     no remote search to fall back to, so it must be unaffected;
 *   - `orphan_pending` — a lookup with `options: []` and NO `referenceTo`, of a
 *     type that is neither `user` nor `owner`. There is nothing to search
 *     against, so the branch's third conjunct must keep rejecting it.
