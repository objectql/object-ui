 * `element:text_input` — the published authoring surface stays in parity with
 * `@objectstack/spec` `ElementTextInputProps` (objectui#3808).
 *
 * `text-input.test.tsx` next door already proves the RENDERER seeds a bound page
 * variable from `defaultValue`. This file proves the complementary and, until
 * #3808, false half: that an author can find out the key exists.
 *
 * WHY THIS BLOCK NEEDED IT MOST. `element:text_input` is deliberately NOT in
 * `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` ("bare inputs belong to a form, not a page block",
 * `packages/core/src/registry/public-blocks.ts:80`), so it never reaches
 * `sdui.manifest.json` and the usual argument — "the manifest advertises it" —
 * does not apply. Its `inputs` are a live contract anyway:
 * `renderers/layout/page.tsx:462` builds the JSX-page compiler's prop whitelist
 * from `getKnownTypes()` plus these same `inputs`, so while `defaultValue` was
 * undeclared, `sdui-parser/src/validate.ts:74` reported `unknown-prop` for it on
 * every JSX page — a warning against a key the renderer then went on to honour,
 * with no way for the author to discover which of the two was right.
 *
 * Expectations are derived from the spec at runtime, not restated.

/**
 * The `I18nLabel` trio — `label` / `placeholder` / `description` (objectui#5717).
 *
 * Same discipline as the `defaultValue` case above and for the same reason: the
 * arms are DERIVED from the spec's verdicts, never restated. Restating them
 * would pin the declaration and leave the fact the declaration exists FOR — that
 * the declared arms are the ones the contract accepts — unmeasured.
 *
 * ## Why these three needed a card of their own
 *
 * `element:record_picker.emptyText` (objectui#5590) and that block's `label` /
 * `placeholder` (objectui#5637) each held a single `'string'` arm for exactly as
 * long as their RENDER SITE dropped the map, and gained the object arm in the
 * change that taught the render site to resolve it — the order
 * `ComponentInput.type` prescribes. This block is the inverse: `text-input.tsx`
 * has resolved all three keys through `pickLocalized` since it was written, so
 * the map always reached the screen resolved, and only the declaration stayed
 * narrow. `ComponentInput.type`'s rule is symmetric and condemns that half in
 * its own words — withholding an arm the renderer resolves makes the manifest
 * gate report `type-mismatch` on a legal write.
 *
 * ## What this file can and cannot see
 *
 * It sees the DECLARATION half — declared arms against the contract's own
 * verdicts. It cannot see the defect itself, which is a `type-mismatch`
 * diagnostic emitted by `validateTree` over a manifest; that path is driven in
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/component-input-union-specimens.test.ts`, where
 * this block gained its pin in the same change. Neither file subsumes the other:
 * this one goes red when the declaration and the contract disagree, that one
 * when the gate and the declaration do.
