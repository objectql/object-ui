 *
 * `element:record_picker.emptyText` resolves the inline locale map the contract
 * admits (objectui#5590).
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` widened this key to the `I18nLabel` union at 17.0.0-rc.6
 * and the installed 17.0.0 GA still carries it — measured, not assumed:
 * `ElementRecordPickerPropsSchema.safeParse({ object: 'account', emptyText: { en, 'zh-CN' } })`
 * succeeds, and the shape resolves to `optional(union(string, record))`. The
 * renderer honoured only the string arm, passing the map straight into a text
 * node.
 *
 * ## Red-first — what the map arm did before the fix
 *
 * Not a mis-render: React REFUSES a plain object in a child position rather
 * than stringifying it, so the whole picker subtree threw
 *
 * ```
 * Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {en, zh-CN}).
 * ```
 *
 * — byte-identical to the pre-fix harm `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx`
 * measured for `schema.label`, which is the same class one key over. Measured
 * on this renderer before the fix and again by mutating the fix away; both runs
 * are quoted in the PR body.
 *
 * ## Why the second locale is load-bearing, not decoration
 *
 * This file's own `toText()` helper already reaches `o.en` as its fourth
 * fallback, so a case that only ever asserts the ENGLISH string would pass
 * against a `toText`-based "fix" that ignores the active language entirely.
 * The `zh-CN` case is the one that separates real locale resolution
 * (`pickLocalized`) from an `.en` pick, so it is the assertion that pins the
 * helper choice the inherited ruling names.
 *
 * No adapter is provided: with none, the fetch effect parks and `rows` stays
 * empty, which is exactly the branch that renders `emptyText` (the disposition
 * `page-variables.test.tsx` already relies on for this block).
