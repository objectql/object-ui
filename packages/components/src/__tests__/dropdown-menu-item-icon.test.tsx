/**
 * `ui:dropdown-menu` resolves an item's authored `icon` to a glyph (objectui#5930).
 *
 * Before the fix both arms of `renderMenuItems` rendered the authored STRING
 * into a text node — `{item.icon && <span className="mr-2">{item.icon}</span>}` —
 * so the catalog fixture literally named `with-icons.json` drew the words
 * `edit Edit`, `copy Copy`, `trash Delete`. The key parsed, published and was
 * documented in the registration's own item-shape description; nothing was
 * red, because no renderer test asserted a glyph here.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are shaped this way
 *
 * The defect is a WRONG RENDER, not an absent one, so `queryByText(name)` is
 * the load-bearing assertion: a test that only asserted "an svg exists" passes
 * against the broken renderer too, since the pre-fix `<span>` sits inside the
 * same item as the trigger's own glyph. Both directions are asserted — the
 * glyph appears AND the bare name does not.
 *
 * ⚠️ `defaultOpen: true` is load-bearing. Radix mounts `DropdownMenuContent`
 * lazily, so without it this suite renders an EMPTY container and proves
 * nothing — the same trap recorded on `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why the renderer is invoked DIRECTLY
 *
 * `ComponentRegistry.get(name)` returns the component the registry actually
 * renders; driving through `SchemaRenderer` injects its own props around it and
 * can be green in both directions (PR #4603's toggle case, restated by #4580).
 *
 * ## Why lucide is NOT mocked here
 *
 * The contract under test is "the authored name is resolved against lucide's
 * runtime `icons` RECORD", and the record surface is a synchronous object
 * lookup with no chunk-loading path to flake on — unlike the dynamic
 * (`LazyIcon`) surface, which sibling suites mock for exactly that reason.
 * Mocking the record here would delete the half of the contract that matters:
 * that a RETIRED spelling resolves to nothing. `edit` is that control — it is
 * a deprecated lucide export whose key was dropped from the record, so it is
 * the case that must render no glyph while `square-pen` (the same object under
 * its live key) must render one.
