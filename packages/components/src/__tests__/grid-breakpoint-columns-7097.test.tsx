/**
 * `ui:grid` renders every breakpoint its `columns` map is authored with —
 * all SIX of the repo's breakpoint vocabulary, not the first five
 * (objectui#7097).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `grid.tsx` carried one static Tailwind class map per breakpoint (`GRID_COLS`,
 * `GRID_COLS_SM` … `GRID_COLS_XL`) and one read arm per breakpoint. Both stopped
 * at `xl`. `2xl` — a full member of `BreakpointName` (`@object-ui/types`), of
 * `@object-ui/mobile`'s `BREAKPOINTS` / `BREAKPOINT_ORDER`, and of
 * `@object-ui/layout`'s `BreakpointColumnMap`, whose `ResponsiveGrid` already
 * emits `2xl:grid-cols-*` — had no arm and no map here. Measured on the base
 * commit through this same harness:
 *
 * ```
 * authored { xs: 1, '2xl': 6 }  ->  "grid grid-cols-1 gap-4"
 * ```
 *
 * The entry type-checked, survived `GridSchema`'s zod mirror, emitted no class,
 * and the grid rendered at its `xs` count on every screen. No error, no warning
 * — the declared-but-not-read shape `skills/objectui/rules/protocol.md` warns
 * authors about, inside the layout key that section uses as its own example.
 *
 * ## Which layer dropped it, and why that decides the fix
 *
 * BOTH layers, and this is the load-bearing measurement. Adding a `2xl` read arm
 * alone would have produced the string `2xl:grid-cols-6` from a template — and a
 * Tailwind class that no static source literal spells is a class Tailwind's
 * scanner never sees, so it is never compiled. The node would carry a class name
 * with no rule behind it: GREEN in this file and unstyled in the browser. That
 * is precisely what the `GRID_COLS_*` maps exist for — their own comment says
 * "Helper maps to ensure Tailwind classes are scanned and included". The fix
 * therefore adds the sixth static map (`GRID_COLS_2XL`, twelve literal class
 * strings) as well as the sixth read arm. `packages/components/src/index.css`
 * scans `../src/**` and this repo defines no `--breakpoint-*` override in any
 * `@theme` block, so Tailwind v4's default `2xl` (96rem / 1536px — the same
 * 1536 `BREAKPOINTS['2xl']` carries) is the variant those literals compile to.
 *
 * ## What this file observes, and why that observation is sound
 *
 * The EMITTED CLASS STRING, compared whole. Not `getComputedStyle`: these are
 * CSS-only Tailwind responsive variants, and happy-dom does not compile Tailwind
 * or resolve `@media (width >= 96rem)` the way a browser does, so a computed
 * `grid-template-columns` here would measure the harness, not the renderer. The
 * class string is the renderer's entire output on this path — `grid.tsx` reads
 * no window, no matchMedia, no ResizeObserver — so nothing is lost by observing
 * it, and `renders-identically-at-any-viewport` below pins that width
 * independence explicitly rather than assuming it (a viewport-dependent pin that
 * is green only on an unpinned desktop default is the failure this repo has been
 * bitten by).
 *
 * ## Why every case compares the WHOLE string
 *
 * `toContain('2xl:grid-cols-6')` would also pass for an implementation that
 * emits the `2xl` class and drops `xl`, or that emits all six classes at the
 * same column count. Whole-string equality makes the other five breakpoints
 * non-regression assertions of this file, so a change that trades one
 * breakpoint for another reddens here. An implementation strictly WORSE than the
 * bug — one that emits no responsive classes at all, the "delete the feature"
 * shape — fails every case below rather than satisfying them.
 *
 * ## Why the case list is derived, not typed out
 *
 * `ALL_BREAKPOINTS` is checked for exhaustiveness against `BreakpointName` at
 * the type level, so a seventh member of the vocabulary makes this file a
 * COMPILE error (`pnpm --filter @object-ui/components type-check`, which covers
 * `tsconfig.test.json`) instead of silently leaving the new tier untested. That
 * is the durable half of this card: the gap survived because nothing compared
 * the breakpoint vocabulary against the keys this renderer actually reads.
 *
 * Module-scope import of the renderers, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md §测试纪律).
