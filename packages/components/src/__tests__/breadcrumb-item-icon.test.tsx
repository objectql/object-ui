/**
 * `ui:breadcrumb` resolves an item's authored `icon` to a glyph (objectui#5931).
 *
 * `BreadcrumbItem.icon` has been a declared, published key of the protocol
 * (`packages/types/src/navigation.ts`, mirrored in `zod/navigation.zod.ts`,
 * documented in `content/docs/components/data-display/breadcrumb.mdx`) and is
 * authored by the catalog fixture literally named `with-icons.json` — while
 * `renderers/data-display/breadcrumb.tsx` contained ZERO occurrences of `icon`.
 * The page named "With Icons" rendered none.
 *
 * The sibling repairs are objectui#5930 (`dropdown-menu`) and objectui#6278
 * (`context-menu`); this suite is that shape ported, with the differences below
 * made explicit rather than copied over silently.
 *
 * ## Difference 1 — the defect is an ABSENT render, not a WRONG one
 *
 * `dropdown-menu` rendered the authored string into a text node, so its
 * load-bearing assertion could be `queryByText('copy')` — the word was on
 * screen. This renderer never referenced `icon` at all, so it drew NOTHING and
 * `queryByText(name)` is null both before and after the repair. The
 * DISCRIMINATING assertion here is therefore the presence of the RESOLVED
 * GLYPH, and that is what every measurement row asserts. The text direction is
 * still asserted, once, as a REGRESSION guard: it is the exact defect
 * `dropdown-menu` shipped, and a future "repair" that printed the name instead
 * of resolving it would be caught by it and by nothing else here.
 *
 * ## Difference 2 — nothing here mounts lazily, and that is a MEASUREMENT
 *
 * The twins pass `defaultOpen: true` / fire a `contextmenu` event because Radix
 * mounts their content lazily; without it those suites render an empty
 * container and prove nothing. `ui/breadcrumb.tsx` is plain `nav`/`ol`/`li`
 * markup with no Radix root and no open state at all, so its items are in the
 * tree on first render. The harness control below asserts that rather than
 * assuming it — a vacuous container would make every "renders no glyph" row
 * pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 * ## Difference 3 — BOTH arms, and where the icon sits relative to them
 *
 * The renderer splits on position: the LAST crumb is a `BreadcrumbPage`
 * (`<span role="link" aria-current="page">`), every earlier one a
 * `BreadcrumbLink` (`<a>`). Repairing only one would be "a narrower version of
 * the same bug" (objectui#5930), so both are measured as their own rows. The
 * fix resolves once per item and renders the glyph ABOVE that split, inside
 * `BreadcrumbItem`, so neither arm can be forgotten.
 *
 * ## The instrument's positive control
 *
 * `BreadcrumbSeparator` always draws a `ChevronRight`, in a SIBLING `<li>`. A
 * bare `container.querySelector('svg')` would therefore be green in both worlds
 * — the blind instrument this suite must not use. Every row scopes to the
 * crumb's own `<li>` and names the glyph by the class lucide derives from the
 * icon's own identity (`svg.lucide-<key>`), while the chevron is asserted at
 * container level as a control ON THE INSTRUMENT: if a `lucide-book` row is red
 * while the chevron row is green, the query works and the authored icon is
 * genuinely absent.
 *
 * ## Why lucide is NOT mocked
 *
 * The contract under test is "the authored name is resolved against lucide's
 * runtime `icons` RECORD". Mocking the record would delete the half that
 * matters: that a RETIRED spelling resolves to NOTHING rather than degrading to
 * a wrong glyph. `layout` is that control — a deprecated lucide export whose
 * key is absent from the runtime record (measured on lucide-react 1.31.0, 1767
 * keys; `Layout === PanelsTopLeft` is TRUE, the retired alias is the very same
 * object under a dead name). It is also the spelling this fixture shipped, now
 * corrected to `panels-top-left`. That row is what rules out the `LazyIcon`
 * surface, which would degrade `layout` to the `Database` glyph.
 *
 * ## Why the renderer is invoked DIRECTLY
 *
 * `ComponentRegistry.get(name)` returns the component the registry actually
 * renders; driving through `SchemaRenderer` injects its own props around it and
 * can be green in both directions (PR #4603's toggle case, restated by #4580).
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT own
 *
 * Fixture spelling drift. `with-icons.json`'s names are judged on every run by
 * `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs`, whose census this card's PR
 * extends with a `'breadcrumb'` entry. This suite pins the RENDERER; the gate
 * pins the SPELLINGS.
