/**
 * BUILT-ARTIFACT PIN — the first resident of the `dist` vitest project
 * (objectui#7183, PM ruling 2026-09-02, option 1).
 *
 * ## What this file is, and why it is not a `*.test.tsx`
 *
 * Every other test in this repository reads its package's `src`: the root
 * `vitest.config.mts` aliases `@object-ui/components` to
 * `packages/components/src`, which is correct for the ~2000 tests that want
 * fast source feedback and structurally unable to answer "does the SHIPPED
 * BUNDLE still do X". This file answers exactly that class of question, and it
 * is the only kind of file that belongs in the `dist` project.
 *
 * The `.dist.spec.tsx` suffix is load-bearing three times over, and each one is
 * a hazard rather than a style choice:
 *
 *   1. `unit` collects `packages/**` + `*.test.ts` and `dom` collects
 *      `packages/**` + `*.test.tsx`. A `*.test.tsx` here would be collected by
 *      the light `dom` project, where `packages/components/dist` does not
 *      exist — the NOT MEASURED failure this card was filed about.
 *   2. `packages/components/tsconfig.test.json` compiles this package's tests —
 *      its include names `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` under `src`. (Spelled
 *      without the glob that pairs a star with a slash: inside a block comment
 *      that pair ENDS the comment, and the file then fails to parse. This file
 *      hit exactly that, and `tsconfig.scripts.json`'s header records the same
 *      trap.)
 *      This file must stay OUT of that program: turbo's `type-check` task is
 *      `dependsOn: ["^build"]` — the DEPENDENCIES' builds, never this package's
 *      own — so a type program that reads `../../dist/index.d.ts` would demand
 *      an artifact `type-check` is not allowed to wait for. objectui#4801
 *      removed a self-referencing `paths` entry for precisely that reason; this
 *      file must not reintroduce the coupling by the back door.
 *   3. `tsconfig.json` (the package build) already excludes `src/__tests__`, so
 *      nothing here reaches `dist`.
 *
 * ## The measurement (objectui#6252 acceptance criterion 3)
 *
 * Re-derived from PR objectui#7180, which ran it by hand and could not commit
 * it: "the id path carries no `body.source` into the built artifact". An
 * id-authored `page:header` resolves an action whose definition carries a
 * script body; the built renderer must resolve the id, must not leak the body
 * into the DOM, and must not write the resolved definition back onto the
 * authored node (that node is what a page build serializes).
 *
 * ## The live control — read this before trusting a green
 *
 * `registers page:header from the BUILT bundle` is the control, and it is the
 * reason a green here means anything. Delete the `await import(...)` line below
 * and that case fails with `expected undefined to be truthy`: `page:header` is
 * registered by NOTHING else in this project, because the `dist` project runs
 * the LIGHT dom setup, which deliberately imports none of the
 * `@object-ui/components` graph. So a passing run has measured the built
 * bundle and nothing else — there is no source path that could have satisfied
 * it.
 *
 * That is also why this project must never adopt `vitest.setup.dom.tsx`: that
 * setup registers `page:header` from SOURCE, which would keep every assertion
 * below green with the built bundle removed entirely.

 * exists to bypass. Held in a variable so Vite cannot resolve it at transform
 * time — with a literal specifier, a missing `dist` fails the file's TRANSFORM
 * and the precondition below never gets to run, which is the opaque
 * MODULE_NOT_FOUND this card names. The bundle's own externals
 * (`@object-ui/core`, `@object-ui/react`, `react`) still resolve through the
 * Vite pipeline, so the registry it writes to is the same singleton this file
 * reads.

 * Guarded by the precondition so "not built" fails as a NAMED assertion below
