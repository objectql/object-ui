/**
 * `packages/components/README_SHADCN_SYNC.md` may not contradict
 * `shadcn-components.json` about which components are re-syncable (objectui#3881).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The README used to publish the whole classification as prose — a
 * `### Shadcn Components` census of 46 names ("can be updated from the registry")
 * and a `### Custom ObjectUI Components` census of 14 ("should NOT be
 * auto-updated"). The manifest is the real source: `shadcn-sync.js` reads its
 * `components` / `customComponents` split to decide what an update may
 * overwrite. Nothing held the two together, so by objectui#3881 they disagreed
 * three ways:
 *
 *   - `resizable` was listed as registry-updatable while the manifest had it
 *     under `customComponents` — whose own entry says re-syncing it BREAKS THE
 *     BUILD (upstream still ships the react-resizable-panels v3 file, which
 *     imports two names v4 does not export). Following the README performed the
 *     breaking action;
 *   - `chart` was in the manifest's `components` and absent from the README
 *     entirely, so a synced component was documented nowhere;
 *   - the custom heading said 14 while the manifest held 15.
 *
 * ## Why this pin holds SETS, and deliberately not counts
 *
 * The filer's sharpest observation on objectui#3881 is the reason this file
 * asserts no totals anywhere: the README's `(46)` still matched the manifest's 46
 * on the day the card was written — because the two membership errors cancelled
 * out (`resizable` counted in, `chart` left out). A count check would have been
 * green across the whole defect. Counts are not a weaker guard here, they are a
 * fake one, and adding one later would re-introduce exactly that blind spot.
 *
 * ## The fix this pin defends is subtraction, not correction
 *
 * Re-spelling the two censuses correctly would have left the drift generator
 * loaded — a hand-maintained second copy of a machine-readable fact drifts again
 * on the next manifest edit, which is how objectui#3767 and objectui#3724 went
 * the same way. So the censuses are gone: the README now states the two
 * categories' MEANING and points at `pnpm shadcn:list`, which prints both from
 * the manifest, offline (it calls `loadManifest()` and no network at all).
 *
 * Exactly one enumeration survives, and it is here on purpose. The diverged set —
 * `customComponents` entries carrying a `divergedFrom` URL — is the subset whose
 * misreading is what objectui#3881 actually cost: not a stale list, a broken
 * build. A reader skimming the page must see that hazard by name without running
 * a command, so the names stay and this file holds them to the manifest.
 *
 * ## Direction — deliberately BOTH, plus a guard that the censuses stay gone
 *
 *   - README names a diverged component the manifest does not mark → the page
 *     warns about a component that is fine, and the next reader learns to
 *     distrust the warning;
 *   - the manifest marks one the README does not name → the build-breaking
 *     hazard is invisible on the page whose job is to warn about it (the
 *     objectui#3881 shape, verbatim);
 *   - the Component Categories section names any `components` key at all → the
 *     census is growing back. This is the one that keeps the subtraction from
 *     being quietly undone, and it is why the section's prose names no
 *     registry-synced component even as an example.
 *
 * Order is not compared, and neither are totals.
 *
 * ## The expected sets are READ OUT OF the manifest, never listed here
 *
 * Hardcoding "resizable" below would rebuild the defect one level up — a second
 * hand-maintained copy, this time in a test that would then have to be edited
 * whenever the manifest changed, which is the edit everybody makes without
 * reading. Both sides are parsed on every run, so a red here is always "fix the
 * README (or the manifest)", never "update the test".
 *
 * `resizable` returning to `components` once upstream regenerates for v4 is a
 * REAL expected future, not a defect, so it is handled explicitly rather than
 * left to a floor that would redden on it: when the manifest marks nothing
 * diverged, the README's subsection must be gone too (see the third test).
 *
 * ## Scan surface — deliberately narrow
 *
 * This file reads `packages/components/README_SHADCN_SYNC.md` and
 * `packages/components/shadcn-components.json`, plus `existsSync` for the paths
 * the README backticks. Nothing else. In particular it does not police the
 * Usage / Manual Sync / Rollback sections, whose fenced command examples name
 * components (`pnpm shadcn:update button`) legitimately — fenced blocks are
 * stripped before the section is judged for that reason.
 *
 * The path check is here because no link gate can see this file:
 * `check-doc-links.mjs`'s per-package `SCAN_ROOTS` row globs one directory level
 * and then matches the exact filename `README.md`, so `README_SHADCN_SYNC.md` has
 * never been scanned by anything — which is also how its `## Files` section came
 * to claim `shadcn-sync.js` sits in this directory when it has always been at the
 * repo root. Widening that scan root is a separate change with its own entry
 * price (the objectui#3603 / objectui#3622 shape: one row plus whatever it turns
 * red) and is deliberately not taken here.
