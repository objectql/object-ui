/**
 * The fullscreen-edit affordance shared by every long-text editing surface: the
 * "expand" button plus the full-height dialog it opens, and the draft/commit
 * state machine behind them.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `components` (objectui#3398)
 *
 * There were two hand-written copies of this state machine — `FullscreenTextarea`
 * in `renderers/form/form.tsx` (the form renderer's built-in, unregistered
 * `textarea` branch) and `FullscreenFieldEditor` in `@object-ui/fields` (the
 * registered `TextAreaField` / `RichTextField` widgets). They exist because ONE
 * form-level promise — `ObjectFormSchema.mobile.fullscreenLongText`, projected
 * onto every long-text field as `mobile_fullscreen` — is honoured on two render
 * paths, and each path grew its own answer.
 *
 * They drifted, exactly as two copies of a state machine do: objectui#3400
 * measured a read-only long-text field that was editable through the built-in
 * branch's dialog, and objectui#3402 measured the same hole for `disabled` on
 * the registered path. Each was fixed on its own side, which is the repair that
 * does not scale — #3393 (the dialog title needs the field label) and #3272
 * (the copy needs i18n) had each already landed on one side first.
 *
 * The merge direction is the maintainer's ruling of 2026-08-10 and follows the
 * measured import graph rather than fighting it: `@object-ui/fields` depends on
 * `@object-ui/components`, and `components` declares no dependency on `fields`
 * in either `dependencies` or `peerDependencies`. So the shared primitive lands
 * HERE, where both render paths may reach it, and `FullscreenFieldEditor`
 * becomes a thin wrapper over it.
 *
 * This is a deliberate, bounded exception to this package's "Pure UI, no
 * business logic" charter (AGENTS.md §3). What it owns is interaction state — a
 * draft string, an open flag, and when a value may leave — not business logic:
 * no metadata is read, no data layer is touched, and nothing from `fields` is
 * imported. Anything widget-specific stays in the caller: the EDITOR itself is
 * injected through `children`, so "fullscreen" is a size change rather than a
 * second, poorer editing surface.
 *
 * ## Draft semantics
 *
 * The dialog edits a LOCAL draft seeded from `value` at open time and commits
 * once, on "Done". It deliberately does not stream every keystroke to the host:
 * these editors sit in a react-hook-form field, and a per-keystroke `onCommit`
 * during a modal edit would mark the form dirty (and fire validation) for an
 * edit the user may still cancel. "Cancel" therefore needs no undo — nothing was
 * written.
 *
 * ## `readOnly` and `disabled` are DEFINED here, not inherited by accident
 *
 * This is the load-bearing half of the merge. Neither copy defined both: the
 * built-in one grew them under objectui#3400, while the fields one declared
 * only `disabled` and was shielded from `readonly` by its hosts' early return.
 * A single implementation cannot be shielded by one caller's control flow, so
 * both states are answered here and both call paths inherit the same answers:
 *
 *  - `readOnly` → NO affordance at all. Not a disabled button: `readonly` means
 *    "shown plainly, not editable", so advertising an expand button the user
 *    cannot use is worse than showing none. This matches what the registered
 *    path already did by early-returning a read-only display before it computed
 *    the affordance, and what objectui#3400 fixed the built-in path to do.
 *  - `disabled` → the toggle STAYS but is inert, because `disabled` means "not
 *    interactive, muted" rather than "shown plainly".
 *
 * Neither state relies on the toggle alone, and that is not belt-and-braces:
 * `disabled` also carries the form's `isSubmitting`, which flips to true while
 * the dialog may ALREADY be open — at that moment the toggle is not reachable
 * but the dialog is. So `openFullscreen` refuses independently of the
 * attribute (a programmatic dispatch and a lost `pointer-events` rule both get
 * past it), the injected editor is told (third `children` argument) so the host
 * can render its own control inert, "Done" is disabled, and `onCommit` is gated
 * — the last of those being THE gate, since it is the single point where a
 * value leaves this component for host state and nothing native guards a click
 * handler on a different control reading React state.
 *
 * "Cancel" and `Esc` stay live in every state — a dialog that goes disabled
 * mid-edit must still be closable, or a submit in flight traps the user in it.
 *
 * A `readOnly` that flips true mid-edit (it is resolvable at runtime from a
 * `readonlyWhen` CEL rule) unmounts the dialog and discards the draft. That is
 * the safe direction — nothing is written — and it follows from `readOnly`
 * meaning there is no editing surface at all.
 *
 * ## Validation state and the accessible name are answered HERE (objectui#4824 / #4832)
 *
 * The editor injected through `children` is built from scratch by the host, and
 * for three surfaces in a row that meant it was built without any of the
 * accessibility wiring the INLINE control gets for free from the form renderer.
 * Measured on all three (`TextAreaField`, `RichTextField`, the form renderer's
 * built-in `textarea` branch): the dialog control had no accessible name at all,
 * and its validation state was either missing or — worse — actively wrong
 * (`RichTextEditorSurface` computed `aria-invalid={!!error}` from an `error`
 * prop the dialog rendering never received, so the dialog announced
 * `aria-invalid="false"` for a field whose inline control was announcing
 * `true` at the same moment).
 *
 * Neither is something a host can be trusted to re-answer once per surface —
 * that is the shape that produced three identical holes. So this primitive owns
 * both, and hands the result to `children` as a required fourth argument the
 * host spreads onto whatever control it renders (the #3417 required-parameter
 * shape). The host never learns an id, so it cannot name the wrong node.
 *
 *  - **Name** — `aria-labelledby` points at the dialog title's own text node.
 *    The visible title is already the field label (#3393), so this reuses the
 *    one naming channel rather than minting a second author for the name
 *    (#3978). The id sits on a `<span>` INSIDE `<DialogTitle>` rather than on
 *    the title element: Radix renders `<h2 id={context.titleId} {...props}>`, so
 *    an `id` passed to `DialogTitle` would replace the id `DialogContent`'s own
 *    `aria-labelledby` names and cost the DIALOG its accessible name.
 *  - **Validation** — `aria-invalid` from `error`, plus `aria-errormessage`
 *    naming a dialog-LOCAL node that renders the message text.
 *
 * ## Why the message text is rendered here at all
 *
 * objectui#3222 ruled that a widget drives `aria-invalid` and leaves the TEXT to
 * `<FormMessage/>`, to keep one copy of it in the accessibility tree. The
 * maintainer's ruling of 2026-08-16 restates that rule as what it was always
 * protecting — "only one copy of the error text is in the accessibility tree at
 * any moment" — which this node satisfies: it exists only while the dialog is
 * open, and for exactly that window Radix `aria-hidden`s everything outside the
 * modal, `<FormMessage/>` included. There is no window in which both are
 * readable.
 *
 * ⛔ The shortcut this replaces is forbidden: pointing the dialog control's
 * `aria-describedby` / `aria-errormessage` at the host's `<FormMessage>` id.
 * That target is outside the modal and `aria-hidden` for the whole time the
 * reference is live — an ARIA MUST violation that no jsdom/happy-dom test can
 * see, because the id resolves and the node has text.
 *
 * `aria-errormessage` carries a SINGLE id (this repo's toolchain rejects a list
 * there) and is emitted only alongside `aria-invalid="true"`, which is the
 * condition under which it is exposed at all. It is deliberately not folded
 * into the host's `aria-describedby` chain.
 *
 * ## Copy
 *
 * Every string goes through `createSafeTranslation` on the SAME
 * `form.fullscreen.*` / `common.cancel` keys both copies already consumed
 * (objectui#3272 on the built-in path, objectui#3404 on the registered one), so
 * the ten locale packs need no new entries and the two paths cannot drift into
 * two wordings. The safe hook — not bare `useObjectTranslation` — because this
 * primitive is rendered without an `I18nProvider` by standalone/embedded hosts
 * and by many bare-render tests; measured with no provider, the bare hook
 * returns the raw KEY for every one of these strings and drops the `{{label}}`
 * interpolation entirely. The English defaults below are byte-identical to the
 * literals both copies shipped, so provider-less rendering is unchanged.
 *
 * Focus management, `Esc`, the overlay and the close button are Radix's, via
 * this package's `Dialog` — deliberately not re-answered here.
