/**
 * Regression: a `visibleWhen` authored on a `data-table`'s `emptyAction` node
 * must actually gate that node.
 *
 * ## The bypass
 *
 * `visibleWhen` is not a per-block concern in this platform. It is enforced
 * ONCE, generically, in `packages/react/src/SchemaRenderer.tsx`: `shouldHide`
 * tests `visibleWhen` ahead of the hoisted `visible` (objectui#5454), sets
 * `_hidden`, and `if (evaluatedSchema._hidden) return null` fires BEFORE the
 * registry dispatches. A block renderer cannot ignore the gate, because it
 * never sees the node.
 *
 * The `emptyAction` slot was the one authored-node exception in the tree: it
 * resolved the registry DIRECTLY (`ComponentRegistry.get(node.type)`) and
 * mounted the result itself, so the node never passed through `SchemaRenderer`
 * and its `visibleWhen` was never evaluated — declared-not-enforced, the same
 * class objectui#5401 / #5505 closed for `record:alert`, one level down. The
 * fix routes the slot through `SchemaRenderer` rather than adding a second
 * evaluator here; a local `visibleWhen` check bolted onto the slot would be a
 * FOURTH evaluator and exactly the drift this repo already records for
 * `page:tabs`' item-level predicate.
 *
 * ## Why the counter-probes are not optional
 *
 * "The gate is enforced" is satisfiable by never rendering the slot at all —
 * which would silently delete the feature and stay invisible to the negative
 * assertion alone. So the true-polarity and the no-predicate cases are pinned
 * beside it, and every case additionally asserts the EMPTY STATE was actually
 * reached (`emptyAction` renders only there): a fixture that never reaches the
 * empty state is green for the wrong reason.
 *
 * ## The fault case is MEASURED, not chosen
 *
 * A predicate naming a genuinely unbound root must behave the way the central
 * gate behaves, not some new way. `evaluateCondition` fails SOFT — an
 * unresolvable predicate answers `true` on every one of its internal paths —
 * so the node stays visible. Pinned here so a future change to the slot cannot
 * quietly pick a different answer than the one `SchemaRenderer` gives every
 * other node.
