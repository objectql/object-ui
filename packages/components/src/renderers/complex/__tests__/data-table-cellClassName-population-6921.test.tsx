 * objectui#6921 — WHICH body cells the SCHEMA-level `cellClassName` reaches,
 * measured in the DOM rather than stated in prose.
 *
 * ## The sentence this file replaces with a measurement
 *
 * For three days a census sentence said the schema-level key was "folded into
 * every body cell's `className`". It was false the day it was written and was
 * copied forward, text to text, for three days before a reviewer measured it
 * (objectui#6882 review, PR #6918). Re-derived here against `data-table.tsx`,
 * the schema-level key is folded at exactly THREE sites, every one a UTILITY
 * cell:
 *
 *   - the selection (checkbox) cell,
 *   - the row-number cell,
 *   - the row-actions cell.
 *
 * The MAIN DATA cell folds `col.cellClassName` — the per-column twin declared
 * on `TableColumn` — and never the schema-level key. The two slots style
 * DISJOINT cells and never combine on one.
 *
 * ## Why every assertion is about rendered `td` elements
 *
 * A prose pin ("the comment does not say every body cell") passes on a comment
 * that has been deleted, and a source-text pin on `data-table.tsx` breaks on
 * any reformat. What the card actually asks is a question about the DOM: given
 * a schema class and a column class, which cells carry which? So this suite
 * renders the table with every utility column switched ON, takes the one body
 * row, classifies its cells by CONTENT (checkbox / row number / value / actions
 * container), and reads the class list off each. The classification is total —
 * four cells, four roles, each matched exactly once — so a cell that changed
 * role or count is reported as such rather than silently skipped.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The fence, as a pin
 *
 * Whether the schema-level key SHOULD reach data cells is a different question
 * the card neither asks nor answers (its ruling would be a renderer change with
 * its own card). The plausible WRONG fix for the false sentence is to make it
 * true — teach the data cell to fold the schema-level key. The first test below
 * refuses exactly that: it goes red when the data cell folds `cellClassName`
 * (measured: the fold added, this file red on the data-cell assertion; the fold
 * swapped for the schema-level key, red on both data-cell assertions).
 *
 * ## Non-regression, the other direction
 *
 * The corrected prose says three utility cells DO fold the key. A later
 * "cleanup" that drops one fold would make the corrected sentence false the
 * other way with nothing going red — so each of the three is asserted by name,
 * and the count is asserted too (measured: the row-actions fold removed, red
 * naming that cell; the selection fold removed, red naming that cell).
 *
 * ## The control: zero cells
 *
 * With no selection, row-number or row-actions column the schema-level key
 * reaches ZERO body cells while the column key still reaches the data cell.
 * That is the reading that broke the original mdx example (objectui#6921's
 * comment record: with `data: []` and no utility column its `cellClassName`
 * reached nothing and the empty state rendered). Here it is the control for
 * the instrument: the schema class is not being sprayed onto every cell by
 * `cn()`, so the three positive hits above mean what they say.
 *
 * The prose these cell names are asserted against lives in
 * `packages/plugin-grid/src/ObjectGrid.tsx` (the schema-slot census) and is
 * pinned by `packages/plugin-grid/src/__tests__/cellClassNameCensusProse-6921.test.ts`.
