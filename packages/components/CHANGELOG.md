### Minor Changes

- ecae400: Retire the `capability-multiselect` field widget name, which existed only on the docs-site registration path and which nothing ever stamped (objectui#3308, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove)

  `field:capability-multiselect` was registered by `registerFields()` and only there. That function's sole caller is the docs site, so the key never existed on the live path (`registerAllFields()`, run at module import, iterates `fieldWidgetMap` — which never listed it). A field authored with `widget: 'capability-multiselect'` therefore resolved to nothing in every real application, while the comment above the registration described it as usable from a record form: a code comment promising a capability that does not exist, which is the worst direction for a metadata renderer AI-authored apps read as authority.

  Nothing stamped the hint either. ADR-0056 P1 stamps `permission-facet-link` on all six `sys_permission_set` facets — `system_permissions` included — through the single `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` choke point, and P2 put the capability editor in Studio. The widget name was a leftover from an intermediate iteration of that rollout.

  Removed, with a tombstone at each site:

  - `@object-ui/fields` — the `field:capability-multiselect` registration and the comment that advertised it. **Breaking in name only**: the key was unreachable outside the docs site, so no application could have resolved it. A field still carrying the hint now degrades to its declared `type` renderer, the defined behavior for an unregistered widget.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `InlineFieldInput`'s `widget === 'capability-multiselect'` branch, the hint's last honoring surface. Leaving one consumer for a name no producer emits and no form resolves is the same declared-vs-enforced split, inverted. The sibling `permission-facet-link` branch is untouched and pinned.
  - `@object-ui/components` — the dead `capability-multiselect` entry in the form renderer's `DATA_SOURCE_FIELD_TYPES` set, which could never match a resolvable widget.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-form` — a comment naming `capability-multiselect` as the widget stamped onto `sys_permission_set.system_permissions`; it names `permission-facet-link` now, which is what is actually stamped.

  `CapabilityMultiSelectField` itself is **unchanged and still exported**: Studio's `PermissionMatrixEditor` imports and renders it directly, which is ADR-0056 P2's design. Only the widget name is retired — the component is not a registry field widget and its doc comment now says so.

  `registerFields()` is also **kept**, with its `@deprecated Use registerAllFields() instead` note corrected. The two are not interchangeable: it registers `createFieldRenderer(widget)`, which synthesizes the label, description and the local `value`/`onChange` state that lets a bare field node (`{ type: 'currency', label: 'Amount' }`) render standalone in the docs demos. Retiring it needs a decision about where that demo chrome goes; the note now records that instead of implying a drop-in replacement.

### Patch Changes

- 794c497: `action:bar` member actions declaring `visible: false` are now hidden instead of rendered

  `action:button` and `action:icon` carried the same truthiness gate objectui#3812
  removed from the member-action leaves — `if (schema.visible && !isVisible)
return null` — so `visible: false`, the most explicit way an author can say
  "never show this", fell into the "no gate declared" branch and the action
  rendered anyway.

  objectui#3812's triage judged the five component-level `schema.visible` gates a
  dormant defensive layer, because `packages/react`'s `SchemaRenderer` evaluates
  `newSchema.visible !== undefined` and hides the node before the component ever
  mounts. Two of the five are not dormant, and this is the difference:

  `action:bar` does not route through `SchemaRenderer`. It resolves each member's
  renderer from the `ComponentRegistry` itself and spreads the whole member action
  onto that renderer's schema, so an author's `visible` on a member arrives as the
  child's own `schema.visible` and lands on the child's gate. `action:bar` is also
  the only gate on that path by design — its `filteredActions` deliberately
  filters on `requiredPermissions` and `actionRendersAt` only, leaving `visible` to
  the member renderer. The path is reachable end-to-end and is now pinned that way
  (registry-mounted `action:bar`, member declaring `visible: false`), so the
  reachability does not have to be argued again.

  Both gates now read the same named definition as the rest of the family,
  `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` (`!= null && !== ''`) — the invariant objectui#3492
  established for the selection bar and objectui#3758 applied to the row-action
  surfaces. The evaluation entry is untouched and already short-circuits a boolean
  rather than handing it to the CEL engine, which `actionPredicate.parity` pins for
  both the engine and the renderer path.

  Behaviour change surface, deliberately narrow: only an `action:button` /
  `action:icon` whose `visible` is the literal boolean `false` (or another falsy
  non-empty value) changes — from rendered to hidden, which is what the
  declaration asked for. `visible: true` still renders, `''` and an absent
  `visible` are still no gate at all, and no expression-valued `visible` changes
  verdict. `ActionSchema.visible` is `ExpressionInputSchema` with no boolean
  member, so `objectstack build` cannot emit this shape; hand-written view JSON and
  in-process callers constructing action defs can.

  The remaining three component-level gates (`action:group`, `action:menu`,
  `action:bar`'s own) stay as they are — they only ever mount through
  `SchemaRenderer`, which resolves `visible` first, and the overflow `action:menu`
  that `action:bar` synthesizes carries no `visible` at all.

- 993336f: An action declaring `disabled: ''` is no longer greyed out forever (objectui#3842)

  The "is a `disabled` gate declared?" test stopped at `!= null`, missing the
  `!== ''` half of the invariant the `visible` family converged on
  (`hasDeclaredVisibilityGate`, objectui#3492 / #3758 / #3812 / #3823 / #3835). So
  `disabled: ''` counted as a declared gate, and the verdict went to the evaluation
  entry — which reads an empty predicate as "no condition → `true`"
  (`toPredicateInput('')` is `undefined`, `evaluateCondition(undefined)` is `true`).

  The direction is why this half is a defect and the `visible` half was not. On
  `visible`, that `true` means SHOW, so an over-broad "declared" test and a
  permissive empty predicate cancel out and `visible: ''` renders either way. On
  `disabled`, the same `true` means DISABLE — the two mistakes compound, and an
  empty predicate stopped meaning "no gate" and started meaning "permanently
  greyed out". One empty predicate, opposite treatment under two keys.

  Two gates now ask the shared definition instead:

  - `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `DeclaredActionsBar` — the hot one. Its actions are
    SERVER-declared (`objectDef.actions[]`) and its hosts are the approvals inbox's
    record sections, so a `disabled: ''` arriving from metadata (an authoring form
    left empty, a template that rendered to an empty string) produced an Approve /
    Reject button nobody could click, indistinguishable from deliberate metadata.
    objectui#3835 was this same surface failing the other way.
  - `@object-ui/components`' `action:button` — verified to be the same shape before
    it was changed (the issue inferred it from the identical spelling but did not
    probe it): with `disabled: ''` the rendered button carried `disabled=""`.

  **Behaviour change surface, deliberately narrow.** Only `disabled: ''` changes —
  from disabled to clickable, which is what "no predicate" asked for. `disabled:
true` still disables, `disabled: false` and an absent `disabled` still do not, and
  no expression-valued `disabled` changes verdict. One consequence worth naming: on
  `action:button`, an empty `disabled` now falls THROUGH to the legacy non-spec
  `enabled` fallback instead of short-circuiting on the empty predicate, so an
  action spelling both (`disabled: ''` + `enabled: true`) becomes clickable.

  The legacy `enabled` leg of `action:button` was routed through the same
  definition for consistency, and that part is behaviour-preserving by derivation
  rather than a fix: the leg is negated (`disabled = !isEnabled`), so an empty
  predicate's `true` already arrived as "not disabled" — the same verdict "no gate"
  produces. All four shapes are identical under either test; the derivation table
  and the reason no test can distinguish them are written down next to the pins.

  `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` keeps its historic name at both call sites (the
  objectui#3842 dispatch ruling): the predicate is key-neutral, and one
  implementation behind two names is how a repo grows dialects. Each call site says
  so in a comment.

- f0a625a: `disabled: ''` no longer greys out the remaining five action surfaces (objectui#3849)

  objectui#3842 / PR #3851 fixed the "is a `disabled` gate DECLARED?" test on
  `action:button` and app-shell's `DeclaredActionsBar`. Five same-shaped sites were
  outside that PR's scope and stayed on `!= null`, so within one component the
  `visible` gate asked `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` while the `disabled` gate on the
  next line asked `!= null` — two spellings of one question:

  - `@object-ui/components` — `action:icon`, `action:group`'s inline button
    (`InlineActionButton`) and dropdown item (`DropdownActionItem`), and
    `action:menu`'s item (`ActionMenuItem`).
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `record:quick_actions`' `QuickActionButton`.

  Why the missing `!== ''` half is a defect on this key and not on `visible`:
  `toPredicateInput('')` is `undefined` and `evaluateCondition(undefined)` is
  `true`. On `visible` that `true` means SHOW, so an over-broad "declared" test and
  a permissive empty predicate cancel out. On `disabled` it means DISABLE, so they
  compound — `disabled: ''` (an empty predicate: nothing declared) rendered a
  permanently greyed-out control, with nothing the author could write to un-grey
  it. Unlike #3842's approvals inbox, these five are the general action face
  (toolbars, dropdowns, record quick actions), so the reach is wider even though no
  single high-value host owns them.

  **Behaviour change surface, deliberately narrow.** Only `disabled: ''` changes —
  from disabled to clickable, which is what "no predicate" asked for. `disabled:
true` still disables, `disabled: false` and an absent `disabled` still do not, and
  no expression-valued `disabled` changes verdict. On the four sites that also carry
  the legacy non-spec `enabled` fallback, one consequence follows: an empty
  `disabled` now falls THROUGH to that leg instead of short-circuiting on the empty
  predicate, so an action spelling both (`disabled: ''` + `enabled: true`) becomes
  clickable. `record:quick_actions` has no `enabled` leg, so its chain is the single
  gate.

  Routing those legacy `enabled` legs through the same definition is
  behaviour-preserving by derivation rather than a fix: the leg is negated
  (`disabled = !isEnabled`), so an empty predicate's `true` already arrived as "not
  disabled" — the verdict "no gate declared" produces. #3842's four-shape derivation
  table is reproduced next to the new pins, together with the statement that no
  `enabled` case can go red by reverting that leg.

  `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` keeps its historic name (the objectui#3842 ruling): the
  predicate is key-neutral, and one implementation behind two names is how a repo
  grows dialects. The three `@object-ui/components` sites import it relatively;
  `record:quick_actions` takes it from the package barrel, the cross-package route
  objectui#3835 opened. Every call site says so in a comment.

- b5980f4: Action-face member actions declaring `visible: false` are now hidden instead of rendered

  The three member-action gates on the action face asked truthiness —
  `if (action.visible && !isVisible) return null` — so `visible: false`, the most
  explicit way an author can say "never show this", fell into the "no gate
  declared" branch and the action rendered anyway:

  - `action:group` in `display: 'inline'` mode (`InlineActionButton`);
  - `action:group` in `display: 'dropdown'` mode (`DropdownActionItem`);
  - `action:menu`'s items (`ActionMenuItem`).

  These leaves `.map()` the component's own `actions` array, so neither
  `SchemaRenderer`'s node-level `visible` handling nor
  `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` (whose boolean `visible` was always
  correct) is in the path — the truthy gate was the only gate.

  All three now read one named definition, `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate`
  (`!= null && !== ''`), and let the declaration itself decide. This is not a new
  decision: objectui#3492 established the invariant for the selection bar, whose
  `hasVisibilityGate` spells out why truthiness cannot answer the question, and
  objectui#3758 applied it to both row-action surfaces. The evaluation entry is
  untouched and already short-circuits a boolean rather than handing it to the CEL
  engine, which `actionPredicate.parity` pins for both the engine and the renderer
  path.

  Behaviour change surface, deliberately narrow: only a member action whose
  `visible` is the literal boolean `false` (or another falsy non-empty value)
  changes — from rendered to hidden, which is what the declaration asked for.
  `visible: true` still renders, `''` and an absent `visible` are still no gate at
  all, and no expression-valued `visible` changes verdict.
  `ActionSchema.visible` is `ExpressionInputSchema` with no boolean member, so
  `objectstack build` cannot emit this shape; hand-written view JSON and
  in-process callers constructing action defs can.

- 8aad9fd: Action-face predicates written against the canonical `record.` root now evaluate

  `action:button`, `action:icon`, `action:menu` and `action:group` gated their
  actions on `useCondition(pred, context)`, which evaluates on
  `new ExpressionEvaluator({ ...scope, ...context })` — and the context each of
  them passed was the row spread flat, or nothing at all. Only the shorthand
  spelling resolved:

  | predicate                    | verdict, before                  |
  | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `status == "pending"`        | evaluates (`action:button` only) |
  | `record.status == "pending"` | throws `record is not defined`   |
  | `data.status == "pending"`   | throws `data is not defined`     |

  `record.` is not a mistaken spelling — it is the canonical one. It is what
  `ExpressionEvaluator`'s CEL path binds (`bag.record` as the record namespace),
  what `evalRowPredicate` binds on the record header, list rows, the row kebab
  and conditional formatting (`record.status` / bare `status` / `data.status`),
  and what the server enforces with. A `visible` that fails CLOSED turns the throw
  into "hidden", so a correctly-authored predicate deleted its own button —
  indistinguishable from the gate having said no. On the fail-soft legs the same
  throw lands the other way: `disabled` greyed a control out for everyone.

  Live rather than theoretical: every declared action on framework's
  `sys_approval_request` gates on `record.viewer.*`, so the whole server-declared
  approval decision set was invisible wherever the declared-action bar rendered
  until objectui#4077 fixed that bar. These four generic renderers carried the
  same binding.

  What changed:

  - all four bind the row the three canonical ways, through one named helper
    (`usePredicateRecordContext`, exported from `@object-ui/react` beside
    `useCondition`), so the action face and the row surfaces answer an author's
    `visible:` the same way;
  - `action:icon` reads the row at all. It evaluated against an empty bag, so not
    even the bare-field shorthand resolved — and its `data` prop was landing in
    the props spread onto the DOM button;
  - `action:menu`'s items and `action:group`'s two leaves receive the row from
    their host, which they previously never got;
  - `action:bar` forwards the row into the overflow menu it builds, not just to
    its inline members. An action's predicate had been answering a different
    question purely because it spilled past `maxVisible` — which on mobile
    defaults to 1, making the verdict a function of the viewport.

  Deliberately unchanged: the evaluation entry and each site's error policy. A
  predicate that genuinely faults still fails closed on `action:button` /
  `action:menu` `visible` and still fails soft on the other legs, exactly as
  before; `toPredicateInput`, `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` and the empty-predicate
  rules keep their pinned semantics. Binding the row is a separate question from
  what to do when the predicate faults.

  A surface with no row of its own binds nothing rather than an empty record, so
  a host that supplies the row through the ambient predicate scope is not blanked
  out; a row passed explicitly still wins over the scope.

- 0cbdca8: Built-in `select` fields: the form's label, validation message and required state now reach the control

  A hand-written form field `{ name: 'status', label: 'Status', type: 'select', options: [...] }`
  rendered a visible "Status" label that pointed at nothing. Measured before the fix:
  `<label for="…-form-item">` resolved to no element at all, `getByLabelText(/status/i)`
  found zero matches, and the trigger button carried no `id`, no `aria-describedby`, no
  `aria-invalid` and no `aria-required`. Clicking the label did nothing and a screen reader
  announced an anonymous combobox with no field name, no error link and no required state.

  Cause: the built-in `select` branch spread its whole DOM pass-through onto Radix's
  `Select.Root`. Root renders no DOM element of its own, so everything it does not
  recognise is silently dropped — and that is exactly where `<FormControl>`'s Slot puts the
  field's `id` / `aria-describedby` / `aria-invalid` and the renderer puts `aria-required`.
  The pass-through now lands on `SelectTrigger`, the focusable `button[role=combobox]` the
  user and their assistive tech actually operate, with the same two keys deliberately kept
  on Root as in the widget-side fix: `name` (the one key Root consumes — it forwards it to
  the hidden native `select` that takes part in form submission) and `disabled` (Root
  disables trigger, items and hidden select together, so the raw prop must not gain a second
  author). `ref` rides the pass-through too, so react-hook-form can finally focus a built-in
  select.

  This is the built-in half of the same mechanism objectui#3306 fixed on the widget side.
  The two halves diverged because `'select'` is a `BUILTIN_FIELD_TYPES` member: an
  object-driven `field:select` resolves to the registered `SelectField` (fixed since #3306),
  while a hand-written bare `type: 'select'` never consults the registry and kept the
  defect. Both paths are now pinned side by side — the registered path as a positive control
  — so they cannot drift apart again. Which component renders a bare `select` is unchanged;
  only where its host props land.

  Authored `className` on a built-in `select` now reaches the trigger (it previously reached
  no element), composed with the branch's touch-target height rather than replacing it.

- d3e738a: Export `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` from the package barrel (objectui#3835)

  `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate(visible)` — "did this action DECLARE a visibility gate
  at all?", i.e. `!= null && !== ''`, with the verdict left to the evaluation entry
  — is the single definition objectui#3492 established and PR #3816 / #3825 / #3836
  applied to every member-action gate in this package and in `@object-ui/plugin-grid`.
  It lived module-private in `src/renderers/action/visibility-gate.ts`.

  The family turned out to have a member outside these packages:
  `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `DeclaredActionsBar` gates server-declared actions with
  the same question and had the same truthiness bug (objectui#3835). Exporting the
  one definition is what keeps that fix from becoming a fifth hand-spelled copy of
  it — the drift shape objectui#3142 already had to unpick for `locations` in these
  same files.

  Additive only: one `export` line, no behaviour change in this package. The
  function is pure and dependency-free.

- c3b01a7: Give composite and grouped field widgets a real accessible name: the form renderer now associates its label by IDREF for widgets that declare `labelling: 'group'`, instead of emitting a `<label for>` that nothing labelable answers (objectui#3961).

  Six widgets rendered a visible group label that named **nothing** in the accessibility tree. Measured in a real form, one field per row, reading each label's `for` against the DOM:

  ```
  address      for=…-form-item -> MISSING            byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  geolocation  for=…-form-item -> MISSING            byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  checkboxes   for=…-form-item -> div                byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  radio        for=…-form-item -> div[radiogroup]    byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  rating       for=…-form-item -> div                byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  file         for=…-form-item -> div[role=button]   byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  ```

  Two shapes, one outcome. `address` / `geolocation` spread the host's id onto their first sub-input and then replaced it with that input's own unique id (objectui#3343, correct in itself), so the `for` named an id no element carried — clicking "Shipping Address" did nothing and the group label was absent from the accessibility tree entirely. `checkboxes` / `radio` / `rating` / `file` kept the id, but on a `div`: a `<label for>` on a non-labelable element is inert HTML — `HTMLLabelElement.control` is `null`, so it activates nothing and contributes no name. A screen reader heard "Street Address", "City", "Alpha", "Beta" — never which group they belonged to.

  The fix is the WAI-ARIA group pattern, driven by a DECLARATION rather than by the host guessing at widget DOM:

  - `@object-ui/core` — `ComponentMeta` gains `labelling?: 'control' | 'group'`. Additive and optional; absent means `'control'`, which is every existing component's behaviour.
  - `@object-ui/components` — the form renderer reads it. For a `'group'` field the `<FormLabel>` publishes an `id` and drops its `for`, and the widget receives `aria-labelledby`. The single-control path is unchanged down to the attribute: no id on the label, no `aria-labelledby` key on the widget, so no field acquires a second naming channel. `ui/form.tsx` is untouched (Shadcn no-touch) — both halves travel as ordinary props, since `<FormLabel>` spreads props after its own `htmlFor`.
  - `@object-ui/fields` — the six audited widgets declare `labelling: 'group'`. `address` / `geolocation` move the host id (and only the id) from their first sub-input to the group container; `checkboxes` / `rating` answer a host-supplied `aria-labelledby` with `role="group"`; `radio` keeps Radix's more specific `radiogroup`; `file` takes the name on its dropzone with no invented group layer, because it has exactly one control that merely happens not to be labelable.

  No new key in the widget props contract: `aria-*` is already declared on it and forwarded by `toDomProps`, the same channel `aria-required` (objectui#3290) travels.

  Deliberately unchanged: sub-labels keep naming their own inputs (`aria-labelledby` overrides `<label for>`, so putting the group name on the first sub-input would have replaced "Street Address" with the field name — the concatenated-name outcome this issue rejected), `aria-describedby` stays on the first focusable sub-input where focus can reach it (objectui#3318), the sub-input ids of objectui#3343 do not move, and standalone rendering — the inline grid editor, a bare SDUI node, where nobody hands down an id and there is no host label to point at — emits no role and no IDREF at all.

  A widget that does not declare itself keeps the old `for`, which the label-association tests report as an association resolving to a non-labelable element. Silence was the failure mode being fixed; the default path stays loud.

- 7ed3360: fix(data-table): don't render a row overflow ("⋮") trigger that opens an empty menu

  The row overflow trigger was gated on whether row-action **handlers** were
  supplied (`onRowEdit` / `onRowDelete` / `rowActionDefs`), while the menu's items
  were filtered a second time — per item, per record — against
  `rowEditPredicates` / `rowDeletePredicates` and a custom action's `visible`. On a
  row where every item was predicate-suppressed the trigger still rendered and
  opened an empty box, which reads as a broken page.

  The trigger is now decided by the items that will actually render for that row,
  resolved through the same visibility rule the items gate themselves on, so the
  two cannot disagree. The decision is per row: within one table a row that keeps
  an action keeps its trigger while a row with nothing left renders none. The
  actions cell itself is unchanged, so the column stays aligned with its header.

- 0fa5e4d: The `div` deprecation notice is now reported once per module load, not once per render (objectui#3965)

  `DivRenderer` called `console.warn` on every render. That is invisible on a page
  with one `div` and destructive on a page with many: the docs schema-catalog index
  renders 400+ example thumbnails and emitted ~190 byte-identical notices, burying
  the page's real console errors underneath — the two nested-button errors fixed in
  objectui#3903 / PR #3964 had to be fished out of that flood, and it cost a
  browser-verification run its signal twice.

  The deprecation itself is unchanged: dev builds still report it, the message and
  its migration guidance are byte-identical, and production builds are still
  silent. Only the repetition is gone. The guard is a module-level `Set` keyed by
  type, and the production early-return happens _before_ the set is marked, so a
  production render cannot suppress a later dev-build notice.

- 5bfaabd: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches every object-bound block, not just
  `list-view` — and `element:record_picker` stops discarding `view`
  (objectstack#6953).

  objectstack#5576 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to `list-view` and left
  the same declaration inert on every other page component. Two gaps remained, and
  both were silent:

  - **`element:record_picker` read four of the five keys and dropped `view`.** So
    `dataSource: { object: 'account', view: 'hot' }` — the spec's own example —
    built a picker over EVERY account instead of the rows the saved view selects.
    Nothing threw and nothing rendered an error; the option list was simply wider
    than what was authored, which also means a user could select a record the page
    said was out of scope.
  - **`object-grid` / `object-form` / `object-kanban` / `object-calendar` /
    `object-chart` / `object-metric` / `record:related_list` read none of it.**
    Each gates its fetch on its own `objectName`, and nothing mapped
    `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page written the way the spec documents
    rendered an empty grid / a field-less form / a board with no cards / an empty
    month / an empty chart / a static metric number — with no request and no
    diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
    objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged on every block:
  a named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error instead of
  degrading to the object's full scope.

  - `@object-ui/react` — new `useElementDataSourceSchema(schema, mapping, dataSource?)`
    and `ElementDataSourceGate` apply a resolved binding to the schema keys a given
    block reads, plus `ElementDataSourceErrorPanel` / `ElementDataSourceLoadingPanel`
    for the two non-final states. One precedence table for all blocks rather than
    one copy per block — that copy is how "additional filter criteria" would have
    become two dialects.
  - A mapping names **only** keys its block genuinely reads. A composed value
    written onto a key the block ignores would be accepted and dropped, which is
    the defect being removed, one layer deeper — so a kanban's swimlane `columns`
    never receive a view's field list, and a block with no row cap leaves `limit`
    unmapped. The per-block coverage table, including two residual gaps that are
    named rather than papered over, is in `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour changes for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

- ab3ad4f: An empty predicate is no longer a declared gate anywhere (objectui#3850, objectui#3862)

  "Is a gate DECLARED on this key — is there a condition to reach a verdict on?" was
  answered three times in this repo, with three different scopes, and the widest
  answers sat on `disabled`, where the mistake is not benign:

  - `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` (the action face) asked `!= null && !== ''`, so every
    OBJECT counted — including `{ dialect: 'cel', source: '' }`. That envelope is not
    a hand-written curiosity: `@objectstack/spec`'s `ExpressionInputSchema` normalizes
    every authored predicate into one, so "the author left the predicate empty"
    compiles to exactly it. The verdict path normalized the same value back to
    `undefined`, and `evaluateCondition(undefined)` answers `true` — "no condition, so
    visible/enabled". On `visible` that `true` means SHOW, so the two mistakes
    cancelled; on `disabled` it means GREY, so they compounded: a button disabled
    forever that no author asked to disable (objectui#3850, the residue objectui#3842
    left behind).
  - `SchemaRenderer` asked `disabled !== undefined` inline, one notch wider again, so
    `disabled: null` greyed out too — on the GENERIC rendering path, since that block
    runs for every node type, and not as an internal flag either: `_disabled` is
    forwarded to the component as a real `disabled` prop (objectui#3862).
  - `ActionRunner`'s execution gates asked "does this normalize to something
    evaluable?" — the scope that turned out to be right (objectui#3848 / objectui#3872).

  There is now ONE definition, `hasDeclaredPredicate`, exported from
  `@object-ui/core` (`evaluator/declaredPredicate.ts`, beside the `toPredicateInput`
  normalizer it is derived from): a gate is declared when normalization still leaves a
  condition to evaluate. `''`, a whitespace-only string, an empty-`source` envelope
  and any non-predicate value (`0`, `{}`) are NOT declared; `false` IS (a verdict is
  not a missing gate — objectui#3812). `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` keeps its name as a
  re-export of it, so the five member-action renderer call sites, `DeclaredActionsBar`
  and `record-quick-actions` are unchanged and inherit the scope;
  `SchemaRenderer`'s `disabled` / `disabledOn` chain and `ActionRunner`'s two gates
  read the same function. No consumer got a local "and also check for empty" test —
  that fourth dialect is what objectui#3842 / objectui#3849 spent two PRs merging away.

  Measured behaviour change, `action:button` and the generic path, before → after:

  | value                                                     | `visible`      | `disabled` | `enabled` | `SchemaRenderer` `disabled` prop |
  | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `''`                                                      | shown → shown  | on → on    | on → on   | forwarded → absent               |

  | `true` / `false` / bare CEL / `${…}` / non-empty envelope | unchanged      | unchanged  | unchanged | unchanged                        |

  Every row moves toward "there is no gate here", never away from it, and no value
  that HAS a verdict changes it — the verdict is still read from the raw value, only
  the gate in front of it narrowed. Two rows are behaviour changes rather than the
  equivalence the ruling expected, and are pinned as such: the whitespace string moves
  on `visible` / `enabled` (it used to normalize to `'${   }'`, which evaluates falsy,
  so a predicate that says nothing HID the action from everyone), and non-predicate
  junk stops greying controls out (fail-open, the posture `ActionRunner` already
  committed to).

  One blank spelling is knowingly still outside the scope: an envelope whose `source`
  is blank but not EMPTY (`{ dialect: 'cel', source: '   ' }`) — the normalizer folds a
  `source` of `''` and does not trim, so the string spelling of a blank predicate is
  trimmed and the envelope spelling is not, and `disabled` still greys out for that one
  value. The ruling enumerated three empty spellings; this is a fourth, measured and
  filed as objectui#3960 rather than widened in here.

  One chain is deliberately untouched: `SchemaRenderer`'s `visible` / `visibleWhen` /
  `visibleOn` / `visibility` / `hidden` / `hiddenOn` legs keep `!== undefined`, because
  narrowing them would change ALIAS PRECEDENCE, not just emptiness. The `hidden` legs
  are not negated and therefore carry this same defect with the polarity that makes the
  node vanish — measured, out of this ruling's scope, filed as objectui#3955.

- c2fd122: fix(actions): forward `bodyShape` end-to-end so a declared body wrap is honoured

  Sibling of the `bodyExtra` fix, same failure shape one key over. `bodyShape` is
  the spec's body-WRAPPING declaration for a `type: 'api'` action — `'flat'` (the
  default) or `{ wrap: key }` to nest the collected params under `key`, the shape
  better-auth's `organization/update` needs. The console `apiHandler` read it
  unconditionally while **no** action renderer forwarded it, so an author who
  declared `bodyShape: { wrap: 'data' }` on an `action:button` / `:group` / `:icon`
  / `:menu` action got a FLAT body on the wire: the endpoint received the params at
  the top level, and the declaration read as honoured because it parsed and
  published.

  The four declared-action renderers now forward the key, and `ActionSchema`
  declares it (typed by derivation from the spec, so the union cannot drift).
  `ActionRunner.executeAPI` — the fallback path taken when no host registered an
  `api` handler — now reads it too, closing a second asymmetry in which the same
  action changed body shape depending on which host executed it. The wrap covers
  the collected params only; `bodyExtra` and other top-level keys stay flat, which
  is the spec's own wording for the key and what both console read-sites already
  did.

  `element:button` deliberately does **not** forward it: its whitelist mirrors
  spec's `InlineActionSchema` pick list field for field, and that pick list does
  not include `bodyShape` — it is not inline vocabulary.

- e24d767: Record page header action predicates now speak CEL, like every other action surface

  `visible` / `hidden` / `disabled` on a `page:header` action were handed to
  ObjectUI's legacy JS evaluator, while the row kebab, the selection bar and
  conditional formatting have evaluated the identical metadata on the canonical
  CEL engine since objectui#1584 / ADR-0058. Every construct that exists only in
  CEL therefore worked in a list row and threw on the record page — where the
  throw fail-closed hid the button, leaving nothing on screen to notice:

  - method calls — `record.f_tags.size() > 0`, `record.f_textarea.contains("x")`
  - the `in` operator — `'"red" in record.f_multiselect'` (a parse error)
  - stdlib functions — `record.f_date < today()` (`today is not a function`)

  Both header evaluation sites now go through `evalRowPredicate`: the same entry,
  the same bindings (`record.*` + bare field names + `data.*` + the host scope,
  with relations bound as the stored foreign key), and the same fail-closed +
  warn-once semantics as the row surfaces. One predicate on one record now reaches
  the same show/hide verdict in the row menu, the selection bar and the record
  header.

  Legacy-dialect strings are unaffected: `${…}`, `===`/`!==`, `?.`, `??` and
  JS-only methods such as `.includes()` still route to the legacy evaluator (with
  its existing one-time deprecation warning), so authored pages keep working. A
  `${…}` template predicate, which the header previously could not evaluate at
  all, now resolves through that fallback instead of hiding the button. A
  predicate that genuinely cannot be evaluated still hides its action, and now
  reports itself once in the same words the other surfaces use, naming the
  surface, the action and the predicate.

- aca561a: Four spec keys the renderers already honoured are now discoverable from the published `inputs`

  `record:details.hideFields`, `record:related_list.relationshipValueField`,
  `record:related_list.add` and `element:text_input.defaultValue` were declared by
  `@objectstack/spec` and read by their renderers, while the registry `inputs` —
  the surface `gen-manifest.ts` serializes into `sdui.manifest.json` and
  `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` — never mentioned them. Nothing anywhere reported the
  mismatch, and every layer that reads a manifest said the opposite of the
  runtime: the keys were in no designer panel and no generated `.d.ts`,
  `sdui-parser`'s prop walk returned `unknown-prop` for an author who wrote one,
  and the renderer honoured it regardless. That is objectui#3407's original
  complaint (`readonly` was enforced and honoured, the description just never said
  so) on four more keys.

  Each description is derived from what the renderer actually does, not from
  restating the spec's one-liner, because the two can differ and the published
  text is what an AI author reads:

  - `hideFields` documents bare field names only — the renderer tolerates
    `{name}` / `{field}` entries but the spec is `z.array(z.string())` and rejects
    them, so teaching that spelling would publish a dialect the contract refuses;
  - `relationshipValueField` publishes the renderer's `'id'` default and says that
    the resolved value drives the list filter, the Add-picker link value and the
    pre-filled create form together;
  - `add` publishes its member shape in prose (`ComponentInput` is flat and has no
    member-shape slot) with each default taken from the renderer — including
    `picker.labelField`, where the renderer defaults to `name` while the spec's
    own wording says "the object title field". It also names `picker.filter` as a
    KNOWN GAP rather than documenting it as a restriction: the spec declares it
    and nothing reads it, so an author would otherwise believe their picker is
    scoped when it offers every record (objectui#3831);
  - `defaultValue` distinguishes the two behaviours an author can get — seeding a
    bound page variable once while it is still empty, versus the native
    uncontrolled initial value with no variable bound.

  `element:text_input` is not in the public tier, so its gap was not in
  `sdui.manifest.json` at all — it was in the JSX-page compiler's prop whitelist,
  which `renderers/layout/page.tsx` builds from `getKnownTypes()` plus these same
  `inputs`, making the undeclared `defaultValue` a live `unknown-prop` warning.

  The repo-wide parity gate now runs in both directions over one covered set and
  one exemption discipline, so neither direction can be forgotten again the way
  the reverse half was after PR #3806. Nine spec keys stay deliberately
  unpublished, each with a written reason and a tracking issue: two the renderers
  do not read at all (objectui#3829), three retired upstream by ADR-0087
  tombstones, `page:tabs.type` (a carrier collision, objectstack#6776), two
  `targetVariable` declarative hints (objectui#3834), and
  `element:record_picker.filter` (objectui#3830).

- 0ef9dfd: `page:card` publishes `children` instead of the retired `body`, and `page:section` / `page:footer` / `page:sidebar` publish the `children` slot they render

  `inputs` is the published authoring surface, not documentation: the Studio block
  designer builds its panel from it, `sdui-parser`'s `gen-manifest.ts` serializes
  it into `sdui.manifest.json` and `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`, and the JSX-page
  compiler builds its prop whitelist from it. Two of the `page:*` containers had
  drifted from the contract in opposite directions.

  `page:card` published `{ name: 'body', type: 'slot' }`. `@objectstack/spec`
  retired `PageCardProps.body` in objectstack#5775 (PR objectstack#6281, merged
  2026-08-07, ADR-0087 D2) and declared `children` in its place — one composition
  slot with one spelling, the same one `grid`, `flex`, `page:section` and
  `page:tabs` items already use. The designer was teaching a key the contract now
  rejects by name.

  `page:section`, `page:footer` and `page:sidebar` declared no `inputs` at all, so
  the designer could not authorize the child list those three components exist to
  render. The same upstream PR replaced their `EmptyProps` declaration with the
  shared `PageContainerProps`, whose single key is `children`; all three now
  publish that one slot from one shared literal, mirroring the spec's own single
  definition.

  Rendering is unchanged in both directions. `PageCardRenderer` still READS `body`
  first (`schema?.body ?? schema?.children`) and the three thin containers still
  read `schema?.children || schema?.body`, so documents stored under the old
  contract keep rendering until the ADR-0087 D2 conversion rewrites the key at
  load time — a back-compat read is not a second authorable spelling, the same
  split the `page-header-subtitle-alias` sequencing established. No validation
  verdict moves either: `children` is already in `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` (so
  it was never an `unknown-prop`), `isContainer: true` was already set on all
  four, and `codegen.ts` filters `slot` inputs out of the generated `.d.ts` where
  `SduiBaseProps.children` types it.

  What changes for an author is the designer surface: `body` is no longer offered
  on `page:card`, `children` is, and the three thin containers gained an
  authorable content slot.

- 7e5bb5d: fix(actions): forward `bodyExtra` end-to-end through the action chain

  An action's static request body (`bodyExtra`) was dropped one hop before the
  `ActionRunner`: every action renderer forwards an explicit whitelist of keys, and
  none of them listed `bodyExtra`. Since `@objectstack/spec` 17 made it the only way
  a `type: 'api'` action can carry a payload (`params` keeps its single meaning as
  the parameter definition array), and the ADR-0087
  `inline-action-api-params-to-body-extra` conversion rewrites older object-form
  `params` pages onto it at load, a previously-working published page validated,
  published and then POSTed an empty body.

  `element:button`, `action:button`, `action:group`, `action:icon` and `action:menu`
  now forward the key; `ActionRunner.executeAPI` merges it into the request body
  **last** (so a constant always overrides a same-named user param, matching the
  console `apiHandler`); `ActionSchema` declares it; and a non-array `params` on a
  `type: 'api'` action keeps working for one version window with a dev-mode
  deprecation warning naming `bodyExtra`.

- 54233b1: Record detail pages: a header ⟳ that refreshes the record, its related lists and its tab counts in place — no browser reload

  Concurrent-editing scenario from the shop floor (MES work orders): operator A sits on a record's detail page while operator B starts or reports the same order. A had no way to see the new state except F5, which throws away the open tab, the scroll position and any in-progress inline edit along with the stale data.

  The pipeline for this already existed — the objectui#2269 invalidation bus refetches every mounted reader in place, and `RecordContext.refresh` had been declared for it — but nothing produced that field and no UI reached for it. Three changes give it a trigger:

  - **`RecordDetailView` produces `RecordContext.refresh`**, publishing `notifyDataChanged({ objectName: '*' })`. The wildcard is deliberate: a user reaches for refresh because of a write made by SOMEONE ELSE, which this client never saw and therefore cannot attribute to particular objects. `'*'` marks everything mounted as stale, so the main record, every related child list and the tab-count badges all refetch — no remount, so tab / scroll / draft state survive. First phase covers the standalone record route; embedded hosts (list drawer, split-pane preview) keep their existing chrome unchanged.
  - **`page:header` renders the ⟳** at the far end of the header row when — and only when — the host provides `refresh`. It is page chrome rather than a header action, so its position is the same on every record page regardless of which business actions the object declares, and it can never be collapsed into the `⋯` overflow. Styled as that `⋯` trigger's twin so the row reads as one button family. Its accessible name and tooltip come from the existing `common.refresh` key, so the icon-only button is not English-only in the other nine locales. The icon spins for a short floor after a click, because the bus is fire-and-forget and a warm backend would otherwise finish before the click looked like it landed.
  - **`RelatedList` accepts the `'*'` wildcard** on the legacy `objectui:related-changed` event, matching what `dataChangeMatches` already does for the bus's own readers. This listener compared the payload's object name to its own, so a wildcard invalidation reached everything on the page except the related lists — a concrete foreign object name is still ignored.

  Hosts that provide no `refresh` render exactly as before.

- 97b63d7: Row actions declaring `visible: false` are now hidden instead of rendered

  A custom row action's visibility **gate** was detected by truthiness, so
  `visible: false` — the most explicit way an author can say "never show this" —
  fell into the "no gate declared" branch and the action rendered for every row.
  Both surfaces of the ObjectGrid row cell (the "⋮" overflow item and the inline
  `variant:'primary'` button) and the data-table's row overflow menu read the same
  gate, so all three rendered it; the `#3562` emptiness guard counts with that same
  gate, so a row whose only action was `visible: false` also grew a "⋮" it could
  not fill.

  The gate now detects a **declared** gate by `!= null && !== ''` and lets the
  declaration itself decide — a boolean short-circuits to its own verdict rather
  than being handed to the CEL engine. This is the invariant objectui#3492 already
  established for the selection bar, whose `hasVisibilityGate` spells out why
  truthiness cannot answer the question, and the same `!= null` posture the
  built-in `visibleWhen` gate has always had. `visible: true` still renders,
  `''` and an absent `visible` are still no gate at all, and no expression-valued
  `visible` changes verdict.

  Behaviour change surface, deliberately narrow: only an action whose `visible` is
  the literal boolean `false` (or another falsy non-empty value) changes — it goes
  from rendered to hidden, which is what the declaration asked for.
  `ActionSchema.visible` is `ExpressionInputSchema` with no boolean member, so
  `objectstack build` cannot emit this shape; hand-written view JSON and
  in-process callers constructing defs can, and did. The three row surfaces now
  reach the same verdict as the selection bar and the record page header for every
  non-expression shape, which `predicate-surface-parity` pins.

## 17.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 3889ffb: Console chrome i18n gaps (objectstack#5407).

  - A dependency-gated lookup now names its controlling field by its **label**
    instead of its raw API name. The sentence was localized but the interpolated
    name was not, so every locale — English included — read `Select crm_account
first`. The form renderer passes a new `dependsOnLabels` widget prop (the
    lookup-side counterpart of `emptyHint`, which it already resolves to labels
    for the fixed-option widgets); a name the host does not cover still falls
    back to itself.
  - The page-header overflow trigger's `More actions` accessible name now reads
    `detail.moreActions`, the same key `action:menu`'s own overflow trigger uses,
    so the two cannot diverge per locale.
  - The activity-feed reaction button's `Add reaction` accessible name is now a
    bundle key (`detail.addReaction`, added to all ten packs).
  - The "check the highlighted fields" toast joins field names with a per-locale
    separator (`validation.formInvalidJoiner`) instead of a hardcoded `、`
    (U+3001) — right for zh/ja by accident, wrong in English and every Latin
    locale. Latin packs use `, `, CJK `、`, Arabic `، `.
  - The Spanish `validation.required` / `validation.unique` templates gained
    their own masculine head noun (`El campo {{field}} es obligatorio`) so the
    adjective agrees for feminine field labels too — `Cuenta es obligatorio` was
    ungrammatical.

- 56409c2: Field widgets are finally told when their field fails validation, and the props
  slot that carries it takes the name the published contract gives it
  (objectui#3222).

  **Breaking** for anyone implementing a field widget (see migration below). The
  repo version policy keeps this a `minor` — objectui's major tracks
  `@objectstack`'s — so read the bump as "breaking within objectui".

  ## The a11y defect this fixes

  `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s `FieldWidgetPropsSchema` — the published contract that
  third-party and AI-authored field widgets are written against — has always
  declared `error?: string`. `@object-ui/fields` declared its own slot as
  `errorMessage`. That looked like a naming split; it was worse:

  ```
  producers of `errorMessage` anywhere in packages/ + apps/ :  0
  reads of `errorMessage` in packages/fields/src            : 15  (7 widgets)
  reads of `props.error`                                    :  0
  ```

  The slot was dead under BOTH spellings. No host ever passed it: the form
  renderer showed validation text through its own `<FormMessage/>` and never
  forwarded the prop. So `EmailField`, `CurrencyField`, `UrlField`,
  `RichTextField`, `PercentField`, `TextAreaField` and `PhoneField` each computed
  `aria-invalid={!!errorMessage}` from a value that was `undefined` forever —
  **`aria-invalid` had never once been set, and a screen reader was never told
  the field had failed validation.**

  Worse than "never set": `<FormControl>` is a Radix `Slot` that hands its child a
  CORRECT `aria-invalid`, but a widget's own attribute is written after the props
  spread, so it wins. Those seven widgets were actively overwriting the right
  answer with `false`.

  FROM: `renderFieldComponent` received no validation state, and the widget props
  type declared `errorMessage?: string`, which nothing produced.
  TO: the form renderer passes react-hook-form's `fieldState.error?.message` down
  as `error` when it renders a registered widget, and the props type declares
  `error?: string`. Both ends of the contract are live for the first time; a
  rename alone would only have swapped one dead key for another.

  ## Migration for widget authors

  ```diff
  -export function MyField({ value, onChange, field, readonly, errorMessage }: FieldWidgetComponentProps< string >) {
  -  return <Input value={value} aria-invalid={!!errorMessage} />;
  +export function MyField({ value, onChange, field, readonly, error }: FieldWidgetComponentProps< string >) {
  +  return <Input value={value} aria-invalid={!!error} />;
  ```

  No alias is kept. `errorMessage` was retained nowhere on purpose — a tolerant
  second spelling is exactly the de-facto second contract AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids,
  and it is what would let a missed call site go quiet again. Because
  objectui#3221 had already removed the type's `[key: string]: any`, every missed
  site is a compile error rather than a silent `any`, so the compiler — not grep
  — validated this rename.

  ## Responsibilities are split, not duplicated

  The widget consumes `error` **only** to drive `aria-invalid` on the control it
  renders (which only it can do — `aria-invalid` has to sit on the input element).
  The message TEXT stays with `<FormMessage/>` in the form renderer. A widget that
  also renders the text double-displays it, and the docs, the agent prompt and the
  tests all now say so.

  For the same reason `required` — also declared by the spec, also never delivered
  — is deliberately NOT lowered into widget props: the required marker has exactly
  one author, the renderer's `<FormLabel>`, and giving widgets the flag invites a
  second asterisk. The a11y state a widget could legitimately carry is
  `aria-required`, which needs no contract change at all (`AriaAttributes` is
  already part of the type and widgets already forward it).

  Builtin field types are unaffected: they render inside `<FormControl>`, whose
  Slot already supplies `aria-invalid`, so `error` is stripped there rather than
  leaking into the DOM as a stray attribute.

  Docs updated to match: `content/docs/guide/plugin-development.md`,
  `skills/objectui/guides/plugin-development.md` and
  `.github/prompts/component.prompt.md` — the last of which additionally used the
  spec's non-generic type alias as a generic (`FieldWidgetProps< number >`) and
  destructured a `mode` prop that exists on neither type.

- 042e09d: **BREAKING (v17)** — field widgets receive their metadata on ONE key, `field`.
  `schema` is removed from the widget contract (objectui#3233).

  ## What changed

  `schema` was a second carrier for what `field` already means. Two producers fed
  it: `SchemaRenderer` passed the authored node as `schema`, and the form
  renderer's `renderFieldComponent` passed `schema={props.field || props.schema ||
props}` _alongside_ `field`. The predictable result was ~30 widgets resolving
  their config as `field || schema` — one concept, two spellings, a de-facto
  second contract (AGENTS.md #0.1).

  - `FieldWidgetComponentProps` no longer declares `schema`. Reading
    `props.schema` is now a compile error, not a silent `any`.
  - Both producers converged. The form renderer passes `field` only. The SDUI node
    → `field` translation happens exactly once, in a new registration adapter
    (`withFieldCarrier`), which every built-in field widget is registered through.
  - All `field || schema` reads in `@object-ui/fields` are now plain `field` reads.

  ## Migrating a widget you wrote

  **Reading the metadata** — replace the fallback with the single key:

  ```diff
  -const config = field || (props as any).schema;
  +const config = field;
  ```

  **Registering a widget** — if your widget can be rendered from a schema node
  (anything `SchemaRenderer` dispatches, not just forms), wrap it once so it still
  gets `field`:

  ```diff
  +import { withFieldCarrier } from '@object-ui/fields';
  +
  -ComponentRegistry.register('color', ColorField, { namespace: 'field' });
  +ComponentRegistry.register('color', withFieldCarrier(ColorField), { namespace: 'field' });
  ```

  `withFieldCarrier` forwards the node **by reference** — nothing is copied,
  narrowed or renamed — and consumes `schema` so it cannot reach the DOM through a
  widget's `...props` spread.

  A third-party widget that still reads `props.schema` and is **not** re-registered
  through the adapter will read `undefined` in v17 and silently render an empty /
  default state. That is the deliberate cost of a major boundary: one contract
  beats N dialects, and a widget that picks the wrong spelling should fail at
  compile time rather than work under one host and not another.

  ## What did NOT change

  - **Host metadata (SDUI JSON) is untouched.** No authored schema changes; this is
    a change to how widgets are _written_, not to what apps declare.
  - **`schema` is still the universal SDUI prop** every registered component
    receives from `SchemaRenderer` (`element:*`, `page:*`, grids, reports). Only
    the _field-widget_ contract retired it. In particular `renderFieldComponent`
    still passes `schema` when a form field type resolves to a plain component
    through the bare-name fallback (e.g. `type: 'text'` reaching the display text
    widget) — that component's contract is the node, and dropping it there would
    render `undefined.className`.

  ## Payload equivalence

  Every path that used to deliver a payload through `schema` now delivers the
  identical object through `field`, and both halves are pinned by tests asserting
  **object identity**, not shape:

  - form path — `packages/components/src/renderers/form/__tests__/form-field-carrier.test.tsx`
  - SDUI path — `packages/fields/src/__tests__/field-carrier-sdui.test.tsx`

### Patch Changes

- 532cf8b: Deliver the required state to the control in the five renderers outside the object form that still painted it as an asterisk only (objectui#3299 — the same defect #3290/#3298 fixed in `form.tsx`).

  Each site converges on the reference shape (`EmbeddableForm.tsx`): the control carries `aria-required={required || undefined}` and the asterisk is `aria-hidden="true"`, so assistive tech announces required once, as a state — instead of hearing a bare "asterisk" folded into the accessible name, or nothing at all.

  - `@object-ui/app-shell` — `ActionParamDialog` (both the boolean row and the default branch, delivered through the real field widgets' `toDomProps` whitelist) and `CreateViewDialog` (display label, machine name, and every type-specific required-field selector).
  - `@object-ui/components` — the custom `ActionParamDialog` (all five typed branches, including the Radix select trigger) and `FieldContainer`, whose existing Slot injection (`id` / `aria-describedby` / `aria-invalid`) now also injects `aria-required`, covering every consumer in one place.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `InlineCreateRelated`'s create-tab inputs.

  Deliberately NOT the native `required` attribute (#3290 ruling): each of these hosts runs its own validation, and native `required` would arm the browser's constraint-validation bubble beside it. The SDUI controls that already use native `required` (`renderers/form/{input,textarea,select,checkbox}.tsx`, `basic/text-input.tsx`) are unchanged — they don't have a second validator, so their channel is already correct.

- 680080a: The required state now reaches the input control as `aria-required`, instead of
  existing only as part of the control's accessible name (objectui#3290).

  The form renderer has always computed a correct `required` — the static
  `required` flag merged with the `requiredWhen` CEL verdict — and then spent it
  on exactly one thing: the red asterisk in `<FormLabel>`. That asterisk carried
  `aria-label="required"`, so the only path from the computed state to assistive
  tech was `<label for>` folding it into the control's **accessible name**: the
  field was announced as "Title required".

  A state smuggled through a name is broken three ways:

  - it is read in name order rather than announced as a state, and "list the
    required fields" style navigation cannot see it at all;
  - a field rendered without a `label` (compact layouts, inline grid editing)
    draws no asterisk, so the signal disappears entirely;
  - `requiredWhen` makes required **dynamic**, and a state channel can express
    the flip where a name cannot.

  ## What changed

  - Every field control — built-in (`input` / `textarea` / `checkbox` / `switch` /
    `select`) and registered widget alike — now receives `aria-required="true"`
    when the field resolves required, and **no attribute at all** when it does
    not. Absence rather than `aria-required="false"` is deliberate: it is what
    the `requiredWhen`-turns-false case has to produce.
  - The red asterisk is now `aria-hidden="true"` and no longer carries
    `aria-label="required"`. It renders exactly as before for sighted users; it
    simply stops being announced, so the state is reported once (as a state) and
    not twice.

  **No field widget needed a change.** `aria-required` is already declared and
  typed on the widget props contract (`FieldWidgetComponentProps &
AriaAttributes`) and every widget forwards its leftover props to the control it
  renders, so all 48 widgets pick it up unmodified.

  Two non-changes, both deliberate:

  - **No native `required` attribute.** That would arm the browser's own
    constraint-validation bubble alongside react-hook-form's `<FormMessage/>` —
    two validators, two UIs, one field. `aria-required` reports the state without
    triggering native validation.
  - **No `required` boolean in the widget props contract.** A boolean would give
    the required marker a second author, and the next widget draws its own
    asterisk next to the renderer's — the double-display failure objectui#3222
    already declined for the validation message.

  If you select the asterisk in a test, it is now
  `span[data-required-marker]` — an explicit locator, rather than an
  accessibility attribute doubling as a test hook.

- a7651e6: The form renderer's built-in `select` branch stops saying "No options available"
  in English to non-English sessions (objectui#3263).

  FROM: the inline branch that renders a `type: 'select'` field — the one taken
  whenever the field is a `BUILTIN_FIELD_TYPES` member, i.e. before the `field:`
  registry is consulted — rendered `{emptyHint || 'No options available'}`. TO:
  `{emptyHint || t('fields.options.empty')}`, the same i18n key the registered
  option widgets fall back to (objectui#3231, all ten locale packs).

  This was the last hardcoded copy of that sentence in `form.tsx`, and the file was
  half-translated in a way a user could see inside one widget: the dependency-gate
  sentence next to it already went through `t()`
  (`fields.options.selectFirst`), so under a `zh` session a gated select read
  "请先选择 Country" and the same select — one keystroke later, when the parent
  value matched no option — flipped to English.

  `fields.options.empty` is added to `useSafeFormTranslation`'s defaults map, the
  pattern `fields.options.selectFirst` already follows there, so a form rendered
  with no `I18nProvider` (standalone widget, test, embedded form) produces the
  byte-identical English string it produced before. Both halves are pinned by
  tests: the Chinese rendering in one file, the no-provider English fallback in
  another (mounting a provider installs it as react-i18next's global default,
  which would erase the state the second one observes).

  The box moved from an inline `<div>` into a small `BuiltinSelectEmptyState`
  component in the same file, because `renderFieldComponent` is a plain helper that
  early-returns on the registered-widget path — a hook called there would run
  conditionally. It forwards its rest props, since `<FormControl>` is a Radix
  `Slot` that supplies the control's `id` / `aria-describedby`; a test pins that
  the field's `<label for>` still resolves to this box.

  Deliberately NOT unified with `@object-ui/fields`' `OptionsEmptyState`: different
  package, different render path (inline branch vs. registry). What the two share
  is the i18n key, not a component — merging them would impose one path's markup
  and props on the other.

- b71fc92: Localize the last untranslated console-chrome accessible names (objectstack#5430)

  Four icon-only controls still carried hardcoded English accessible names, so
  under a non-English session they were the only English left in the record
  chrome — and because the controls have no visible label, that literal _is_ the
  control to a screen reader and to the hover tooltip.

  - `page:header`'s `role="toolbar"` — now `detail.pageHeaderActions` (its `⋯`
    overflow trigger eight lines below was fixed in #5407; the toolbar was missed)
  - `ReactionPicker`'s `role="listbox"` popup — now `detail.emojiPicker`
  - `ReactionPicker`'s per-reaction chip, which built its name by concatenation
    with English pluralization baked in (`reaction${count !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`) —
    now `detail.reactionCount` / `detail.reactionCountOne`
  - `NavigationOverlay`'s drawer close and split-panel close — now `common.close`
    (the key the rest of the console already uses) and `common.closePanel`

  The pluralized label follows this repo's **two-key** convention
  (`detail.relatedRecords`/`relatedRecordOne`, `lookup.recordCount`/`recordCountOne`)
  rather than an i18next `_one`/`_other` pair: zh/ja/ko have no separate singular
  form, so those packs would legitimately omit the `_one` half and
  `all-locales-key-parity` would read that as a lost key.

  All five new keys are added to all ten locale packs.

- 34595eb: The Combobox trigger now declares `type="button"` explicitly, so it can never
  submit an enclosing `<form>` (objectui#3344). The current Radix
  `PopoverTrigger` happens to supply `type="button"` through its Slot, but that
  form-safety guarantee was an upstream implementation detail — it is now a
  locally declared, regression-tested contract, matching the explicit style of
  LookupField / MultiSelectField / RatingField. The default sits before the
  trigger pass-through spread (objectui#3318), so a consumer who explicitly
  passes `type` (e.g. `type="submit"`) still wins.
- 9cbcbf4: The form renderer's built-in `textarea` branch reads the fullscreen long-text
  flag on one spelling (objectui#3303).

  FROM: the branch resolved the affordance as `mobile_fullscreen || fullscreen`,
  and both prop strips (`stripRendererOnlyProps`, `stripRegisteredFieldProps`)
  carried a matching entry discarding a `fullscreen` key. TO: a single read of
  `mobile_fullscreen`, with no strip entry left for the alias.

  No runtime behaviour changes for anything that exists, because the second term
  was permanently `undefined`. `fullscreen` had **no producer**: a repo-wide grep
  plus `objectstack`'s `packages/spec` turns up only the unrelated
  feedback/loading overlay property of the same name, never a form field. The one
  real producer is `ObjectForm`, which stamps `mobile_fullscreen` onto long-text
  fields from `ObjectFormSchema.mobile.fullscreenLongText` — the same single
  carrier `TextAreaField` and `RichTextField` read.

  This closes the last member of the convergence run objectui#3232 / #3233 /
  #3245 / #3301 started. The changeset for #3232 named this branch explicitly as
  "a separate live path" still accepting two spellings; it is now single-read like
  the two widgets, so the same authored metadata behaves the same way whether a
  field type resolves to a registered widget or falls through to the built-in
  branch.

  Why a no-producer alias is worth removing rather than leaving as harmless
  insurance: it is not insurance, it is a contract that never held. The renderer
  advertised a spelling to whoever reads it next — very much including an AI
  writing form metadata — and that spelling silently does nothing, with no error
  and nowhere to look. That is the lenient consumer fallback AGENTS.md #0.1
  forbids, and the identical mechanism behind #3245 and #3301. Dropping the strip
  entries matters for the same reason: a key nobody produces should not get a
  dedicated discard, it should be in the ordinary unrecognised-key class, so a
  typo is as visible as any other typo instead of being quietly swallowed.

  Pinned by tests in both places the alias lived: the built-in branch renders the
  expand affordance for `mobile_fullscreen` and not for `fullscreen` (the
  canonical case is asserted alongside the alias case, so the negative cannot pass
  for the empty reason of the affordance having disappeared altogether), and the
  strips are shown to own `mobile_fullscreen` — stripped from the top-level props,
  delivered on `field` — while `fullscreen` is now indistinguishable from an
  arbitrary unknown key.

- 85c4c9c: 表单内置 `textarea` 的全屏编辑对话框现在能拿到字段自己的 label：对话框标题显示字段名而不是恒定的通用词「编辑文本」，同一张表单上多个长文本字段的展开按钮也终于有了互不相同的无障碍名（objectui#3393）。

  `renderFormField` 在解构字段配置时把 `label` 单独取走了（它要渲染 `<FormLabel>`），而下游 `renderFieldComponent` 唯一调用点重建 props 对象时显式补回了 `field` / `inputType` / `options` / `placeholder` / `emptyHint` / `dependsOnLabels` 等等，唯独漏了 `label`。于是内置 `textarea` 分支里的 `label` 恒为 `undefined`，`FullscreenTextarea` 中两条依赖它的分支从写下那天起就没走到过：

  - 对话框标题 `label ?? t('form.fullscreen.title')` 永远落到通用词——一个叫「备注」的字段点开全屏编辑，标题不会说自己是「备注」；
  - 展开按钮的无障碍名永远插值通用名词，一张有三个长文本字段的表单上三个按钮读屏完全一样。读屏用户无法判断自己要展开的是哪个字段，这是可达性缺陷而不是观感问题。

  ## 改了什么

  - 调用点显式转发 `label`（与 `placeholder` / `emptyHint` 同法），这是唯一的行为改动。
  - `label` 属于 renderer-only：`stripRendererOnlyProps` 与 `stripRegisteredFieldProps` 各加一条丢弃项，所以它既不会变成 DOM 上的 `label="备注"` 杂属性（每个内置分支都会把剩余 props 直接摊到 DOM 节点上），也不会成为注册型 widget 新收到的 prop——自 v17 起 `field` 是它们唯一的元数据载体（objectui#3233），label 一直在那里读。
  - 内置 `textarea` 分支里那句 `const { label: _label, ...rest }` 随之删除。它本想拦住 label 落到 DOM，但既然从来没有 label 送进来，它拦的是不存在的东西（ESLint 一直报着 `'_label' is assigned a value but never used`），而且只护住了这一个分支。现在这件事由 strip 统一负责，所有分支同等受护。

  十个语言包零改动：#3272 把 `form.fullscreen.toggle` 做成了带 `{{label}}` 插值的整句（zh 插在句尾、ja 插在句首），label 一通，十个语言的句子直接就对。字段没有 label 时仍回落到被翻译的通用词。

- fd54c3e: The form renderer's built-in `textarea` branch now honours `readonly` / `disabled` on its fullscreen exit, which previously bypassed both (objectui#3400). `renderFieldComponent` destructures `readonly` off its props, so it is absent from the `...rest` each branch spreads; the plain exit put it back as `readOnly={readonly}` plus the read-only tint, the `mobile_fullscreen` exit put back neither. `FullscreenTextarea` then renders three controls — the inline textarea, the expand button, and the dialog's own textarea — of which only the first ever saw a spread prop. So a read-only long-text field was editable in place without even opening the dialog, and a disabled one looked correctly greyed out while its expand button stayed live, its dialog accepted any edit, and "Done" wrote that edit back into form state. Neither is an exotic combination: `ObjectForm` stamps `mobile_fullscreen` onto every long-text field when `mobile.fullscreenLongText` is set without consulting either flag, `readonly` is also resolved at runtime from a `readonlyWhen` CEL rule, and `disabled` is additionally true for the whole form while a submit is in flight — so a submit in progress did not stop a long-text edit either. A read-only field now renders no expand button at all, matching the registered `TextAreaField` path so both renderers give the same metadata the same behaviour; a disabled field keeps the button but disables it. Both states also lock the dialog's textarea and its "Done" button independently, because `disabled` can flip to true while the dialog is already open. Editable long-text fields are unaffected.
- 4eeb932: The form renderer's last user-visible English literals now go through i18n (#3272). The fullscreen long-text editor (`mobile_fullscreen`) was an entire untranslated dialog — title, screen-reader description, `Cancel` / `Done` footer buttons, and the expand trigger's accessible name — rendering English inside an otherwise translated zh/ja/ar form; it now reads the new `form.fullscreen.*` keys, shipped in all ten locale packs.

  **Behaviour change worth reading if you author forms:** `submitLabel` and `cancelLabel` no longer default to the literals `'Submit'` and `'Cancel'` in the renderer. They default to _unset_, and the action bar falls back at render time to `common.submit` / `common.cancel`, so a form that declares no button copy now follows the session language instead of being silently frozen to English. A label you DO declare still wins verbatim in every locale — including an English one under a zh session, and including an explicit empty string (the fallback uses `??`, so `submitLabel: ''` renders a blank button rather than being overwritten). The only forms whose rendered text changes are those that never declared the labels and are viewed in a non-English session — which is the bug. `FormSchema.submitLabel` / `cancelLabel` stay optional strings; no spec or type change.

  Also removed the built-in `select` branch's second `|| 'Select an option'` fallback. The single call site already supplies `t('common.selectOption')`, so the literal was reachable only through an authored `placeholder: ''` — where it replaced the author's deliberate blank with an untranslated English word.

- 53811d1: Associate the label with its control at the two form surfaces where the two were never programmatically connected (objectui#3341 — found while implementing #3299/PR #3340, and deliberately left out of that PR's scope fence as a different class of defect).

  `aria-required` reaching the control (#3299) only fixes the required _state_; at these two sites the control's accessible _name_ was still wrong, because the label pointed at nothing:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `InlineCreateRelated`'s create-tab fields rendered a `<label>` with no `htmlFor` beside an `<Input>` with no `id`, and the two were siblings rather than wrapper/child. The field label was unreachable for assistive tech, and clicking the label did not focus the input. The ids are namespaced with `React.useId`, because `field.name` alone is unique only within one instance and a detail page mounts one of these per related list.
  - `@object-ui/components` — the custom `ActionParamDialog`'s `select` branch rendered `<Label htmlFor={param.name}>` but never put the matching `id` on its Radix `SelectTrigger`, so the reference dangled. The textarea / number / date / text branches already set `id={param.name}`; select was the only one that did not.

  `SelectTrigger` renders a `<button role="combobox">`, and `button` is a labelable element, so the plain `htmlFor`/`id` pair is the correct association there — no `aria-labelledby` required. No spec change and no widget-props contract change.

- d915c47: Relation fields (`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`) are now usable in action and conditional-formatting predicates: they bind as the stored foreign key on every surface, and the fields a predicate reads are included in the query projection (#3501).

  Before this, one predicate over one relation field had four different fates, decided by things its author does not control. `$expand` **replaces** the id in place with the whole related record, and a view expands exactly the relations it shows as COLUMNS — so `record.owner == "U1"` was **true** where the column was absent, **false** where it was displayed, and a **fault** where the field was neither displayed nor projected (a list's `$select` was built from its columns alone, and CEL treats an absent key as a fault, not as null). A fault is fail-CLOSED on the row kebab and the selection bar and fail-OPEN on the lenient paths, so the same authoring mistake hid the button from everyone on one surface and showed it to everyone on the next, with nothing on screen to point at either. The server, meanwhile, only ever sees the id — so client and server could not agree, which is the one thing ADR-0036 / ADR-0058 exist to guarantee.

  Two changes close it. `toPredicateRecord` (new, `@object-ui/core`) collapses expanded relation values back to their ids when a record is bound for evaluation — driven by the object's own field types, not by sniffing for an `id` key, so a `json` field that happens to carry one is untouched. It is threaded through `evalRowPredicate` / `resolveConditionalFormatting` (via a new `fields` option), `useRowPredicate`, `partitionBulkRows`, and both `page:header` evaluators, with the object schema supplied by `ObjectGrid` / `ListView` / `ObjectKanban` / the record context. Kanban card formatting is threaded the same way, so a rule cannot match on the grid view of a list and silently never match on its board. Display is unaffected — a detail-page title still renders the related record's name, and the schema-only `kanban-ui` entry point (which has no object schema to offer) keeps using the payload verbatim. `collectPredicateFieldRefs` / `listViewPredicates` (new) harvest the `record.x` / `data.x` references out of a view's conditional formatting, row-action defs, bulk-action defs, promoted object actions and `userActions` overrides, and add them to `$select` — intersected with the object's declared fields plus the platform columns every object carries (`isProjectableField`), because an unknown key is not ignored by every backend. No `$expand` is added: a predicate wants the foreign key, which is what an unexpanded relation already is.

- 825bbe3: The option widgets' "this list cannot be filled" message now has one source, and
  it is translated (objectui#3231).

  FROM: `SelectField`, `MultiSelectField`, `RadioField` and `CheckboxesField` each
  carried their own copy of the empty/gated state, each destructured the declared
  `emptyHint` prop into `_emptyHint` and dropped it, and each rendered a hardcoded
  English literal (`'No options available'`, `` `Select ${…} first` ``) even in a
  Chinese or Japanese session. TO: one shared `OptionsEmptyState` — the host's
  `emptyHint` when it supplied one, otherwise a translated fallback
  (`fields.options.empty` / `fields.options.selectFirst`, added to all ten locale
  packs).

  `emptyHint` was declared, produced by the form renderer and transported, then
  lost three times over — so no registered widget could ever render it. All three
  breaks are fixed, because closing only the last one delivers nothing:

  - `isOptionField` compared the raw resolved type against `'select'` /`'radio'` /
    `'multiselect'` / `'checkboxes'`. Object-derived forms emit
    `mapFieldTypeToFormType`'s prefixed ids (`field:select`), which matched none of
    them, so for every option field coming from an object schema — the normal case
    in the console — the whole cascade block was skipped and no hint was computed
    at all. It now normalizes the `field:` prefix, the same normalization
    `stripRegisteredFieldProps` already applied a few lines below.
  - `stripRegisteredFieldProps` then removed the `emptyHint` key from what was
    left. It is now forwarded to the four cascade option types, alongside
    `dependentValues`. This stays an allow-list rather than a blanket
    pass-through: every other registered widget spreads its leftover props onto a
    DOM node, where an unknown `emptyHint` attribute is a React warning.
  - the widgets themselves discarded it. Keeping it out of the `...props` spread
    was correct; not using it afterwards was not.

  User-visible effect: a dependency-gated option list now prompts with the
  controlling field's **label** ("Select Country first") instead of its raw
  metadata name, in the session's language; an unconfigured list says so in the
  session's language too. The gate sentence is one i18n key shared by the renderer
  and the widget fallback, so the two sides cannot word it differently.

  Untouched: the built-in (unregistered) `select` branch of the form renderer,
  which already consumed `emptyHint`. That is a separate live path.

- 5dd0127: Localize the record-overlay and tab-badge chrome that #5430's sweep left behind (objectstack#5506)

  Four more console-chrome strings were still hardcoded English literals. Unlike
  #5430's set they are not all accessible names — one is visible copy, and one was
  a component **default** that only the console happened to override.

  - `page:tabs`' count badge built its `aria-label` by template literal,
    `` `${formatTabCount(count)} items` ``. The badge renders digits only, so that
    label _is_ the badge to a screen reader — and the English plural was baked in
    with no singular branch at all, so a related list with one row announced
    "1 items". Now `common.itemCount` / `common.itemCountOne`.
  - `NavigationOverlay`'s drag-resize handle (`role="separator"`, no visible label)
    — now `common.resizeDrawer`.
  - `NavigationOverlay`'s `expandLabel` **default**. Hosts may override it and the
    console does, but the default is what every other host ships — and it feeds
    both `aria-label` and `title` of an icon-only button. Now
    `detail.openAsFullPage`, still overridable by the prop.
  - `NavigationOverlay`'s `resolvedTitle` fallback, `'Record Detail'` — **visible**
    overlay heading, not just an a11y name. Now `detail.recordDetail`.
  - The sr-only `SheetDescription`/`DialogDescription` prose
    `Record detail overlay for {title}.`, which existed in three copies
    (drawer / modal / popover) — now one `detail.recordDetailOverlay` key with a
    `{{title}}` placeholder.

  The count badge follows this repo's **two-key** plural convention
  (`detail.reactionCount`/`reactionCountOne`, `detail.relatedRecords`/`relatedRecordOne`)
  rather than an i18next `_one`/`_other` pair: zh/ja/ko have no separate singular
  form, so those packs would legitimately omit the `_one` half and
  `all-locales-key-parity` would read that as a lost key. The formatted count
  (`1.2k`, not `1200`) is interpolated so the accessible name and the visible
  digits never disagree — and because i18next skips its own plural resolution when
  `count` is a string, the two-key scheme stays in charge of the choice.

  Both touched components moved from `useSafeTranslate` to `createSafeTranslation`,
  which carries an options bag (two of the new keys interpolate) and an English
  defaults map. That map is what keeps the provider-less path English, which
  consumers outside this package depend on — `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView.test.tsx`
  and `e2e/live/inline-edit-polish-2572.spec.ts` address this chrome by English
  accessible name with no `I18nProvider` mounted.

  All six new keys are added to all ten locale packs.

- 06632e9: `PageRenderer` no longer renders its own `<h1>` when the page authors a titled `page:header`, so a page has exactly one level-1 heading. Every non-record page used to render the page `title`/`label` as an `h1` _and_ let the `page:header` block render a second one — on the showcase master-detail page both said "New Project + Tasks", producing a broken document outline, a page title a screen reader announces twice, and the same string printed twice on screen. Record pages already delegated the whole title block to `page:header`; that rule now holds for `app` / `home` / `utility` pages too, and it is what the live e2e was reporting as a Playwright strict-mode violation (`getByRole('heading', { name })` resolving to 2 elements, objectui#3434).

  Delegation is deliberately conservative: only a `page:header` whose title renders literal text takes the heading over. A header with no title — or one whose title interpolates to nothing (e.g. `title: '{name}'` with no record in scope) — renders no heading of its own, so the page keeps its implicit `h1` rather than ending up with none. The page-level `description` is unaffected; it is the page's own prose, not a duplicate of the header `subtitle`.

  Author-visible effect: on a page carrying both a `label` and a titled `page:header`, only the header's title is shown (e.g. app-crm's welcome page shows "Welcome to the CRM", not also "CRM Welcome"). Pages without a `page:header` are unchanged.

- a4cff5b: Conditional-rule predicates that fail to evaluate are no longer silent
  (objectstack#5149, appeal 2). `evalFieldPredicate` — the canonical funnel for
  `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`, view-level `visibleOn`, legacy
  `condition`, per-option `visibleWhen`, screen-field predicates and list
  conditional formatting — now logs **one `console.warn` per predicate text**
  when evaluation fails (parse error, unbound identifier, engine fault), carrying
  the predicate source, the engine's failure reason, and the field/rule locator
  the call site provides. Renderer call sites thread that locator
  (`visibleWhen of field 'amount'`), so a broken predicate identifies itself in
  the browser console instead of being indistinguishable from an absent one.

  Verdicts are unchanged: evaluation still fails open to the caller's safe
  default (flipping that default is objectstack#5149 appeal 1, tracked
  separately). Fault-probing callers (`evalRowPredicate`'s fail-closed path,
  `ExpressionEvaluator`'s `throwOnError`) opt out via the new
  `diagnostic.warn: false` and keep their own single diagnostic, so no broken
  predicate ever warns twice.

- 71be406: The close button that the `Sheet` and `Dialog` primitives auto-render now announces itself in the session locale instead of always in English. Both buttons are icon-only (a lucide `X`), so their `sr-only` span is not decoration — it IS the control's accessible name, and upstream Shadcn ships it as a hardcoded English literal. Under zh/ja/es every drawer and modal in the console (~20 `SheetContent` consumers plus every `DialogContent` consumer — ChatDock, ActivityFeed, metadata-admin, AiChatPage, BuildDebugDrawer, PeoplePicker, RecordDetailDrawer, …) announced "Close" to a screen reader. The span now renders `<CloseSrLabel />`, which resolves `common.close` (present in all ten locale packs since objectstack#5430) and falls back to English when no `I18nProvider` is mounted, so existing suites and e2e specs that address these controls by their English name are unaffected (objectstack#5505).

  Because `packages/components/src/ui/**` is regenerated from the Shadcn registry, the edit is not a hand patch that the next `pnpm shadcn:update` would silently revert: it is declared as data in `scripts/shadcn-local-patches.mjs`, re-applied automatically on every sync (including `--force`), and enforced in both directions — `pnpm shadcn:check` now exits non-zero if a declared patch is missing from the file on disk or can no longer be re-applied to current upstream, and an offline test gates the same invariant on every PR.

- 8d8094a: 20 more registered field widgets now announce a failed validation to assistive
  tech: `multiselect`, `radio`, `checkboxes`, `tags`, `lookup`, `master_detail`,
  `user`, `owner`, `file`, `image`, `location`, `object`, `color`, `rating`,
  `code`, `avatar`, `address`, `geolocation`, `qrcode` and `object-ref` carry
  `aria-invalid="true"` on their real focusable control after a validation
  failure, where before the red message rendered while a screen reader was told
  nothing (objectui#3318, the registry-wide gap objectui#3306's sweep measured).

  Each widget follows the objectui#3222/#3306 pattern: the `toDomProps(props)`
  whitelist spread goes onto the control the user actually focuses — the input,
  the lookup trigger button, the radiogroup (`role="radiogroup"` is the
  ARIA-designated carrier for a set of radios), every chip/checkbox/star of the
  composite option widgets, the upload dropzone/button — followed by an explicit
  `aria-invalid={!!error}` computed from the published `error` slot. Wrapper
  `<div>`s never carry the state, and `name` is withheld from non-form-control
  elements (the objectui#3291 leak class).

  `Combobox` (`@object-ui/components`) now accepts standard button attributes
  and forwards them to its focusable `role="combobox"` trigger, giving
  combobox-based widgets an element to deliver `aria-invalid` /
  `aria-describedby` to — the same seam objectui#3306 opened on
  `SelectTrigger`.

  Nine types remain on the objectui#3318 ratchet ledger with their blockers
  documented there (`formula`/`summary`/`auto_number`/`vector` render no
  focusable control; `grid`, `slider`, `signature` need component-level design;
  `filter-condition`/`recipient-picker` deliver in their editable states but
  render a dependency-gate hint with no control in a fresh form).

## 17.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4ae0ac4: One placement rule for action `locations` (objectui#3142).

  **Breaking for metadata**: an action that declares no `locations` (missing key
  or `[]`) no longer renders in a located surface. FROM: omitting `locations`
  made an action appear on the list toolbar, the record header, and every
  metadata-admin toolbar. TO: declare where it belongs —
  `locations: ['record_header']` for the record header, `['list_toolbar']` for
  the list toolbar, and so on. Nothing else changes; actions that already
  declare a location are untouched.

  Four renderers each answered "where does an action with no `locations` go?"
  differently — `action:bar` and metadata-admin showed it EVERYWHERE,
  `page:header` showed it on the header, `action:group` showed it for
  `undefined` but hid it for `[]` — while `ActionEngine`, `RecordDetailView`,
  `DeclaredActionsBar`, the related-list bridge and the environment toolbar all
  showed it NOWHERE. The same action therefore appeared or vanished depending on
  which component happened to draw it. All eight now go through one exported
  predicate, `actionRendersAt(action, location)` from `@object-ui/types`: an
  action renders at a location only if it declares that location.

  The strict reading is the platform's own — ADR-0078 lists "an `action` with no
  `locations`" as a verified inert shape, and the detail-page synthesizer already
  documented "must include `locations: ['record_header']` to render". The
  leniency contradicted both, and it is what let an aggregate-only bulk action
  (objectui#3139) — one with no single-record placement by construction — mint a
  list-toolbar button whose dispatch could only fail.

  Two placements are declared elsewhere and need no `locations`, both unchanged:
  host-injected chrome in the `systemActions` / `headerSystemActions` slot (now
  consistently exempt on `page:header` too, where it used to be filtered), and an
  action named in a view's `bulkActions` / `bulkActionDefs`.

  Authoring side: Studio seeds `locations: ['record_header']` on a new action
  instead of minting one that renders nowhere, and the action inspector says so
  when no placement is ticked. The `ActionSchema.locations` JSDoc claimed a
  `['record_header']` default that no renderer ever implemented — corrected.

- 09d30a4: Stop declaring 18 `@object-ui/auth` / `@object-ui/components` / `@object-ui/react`
  symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns (objectui#3159, objectstack#4115
  batch 5).

  **Breaking for importers of all three packages** — six exported names changed,
  because the spec exports the same name for a _different_ thing:

  | package      | was                          | now                      | what the spec's same-named export actually is                                  |
  | :----------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `auth`       | `AuthSession`                | `AuthClientSession`      | the SERVER's session record (`{ id, userId, expiresAt: ISO string, token? }`)  |
  | `auth`       | `AuthProviderConfig`         | `AuthProviderOptions`    | an OAuth/OIDC provider registration (`{ id, clientId, clientSecret, scope? }`) |
  | `components` | `FilterCondition`            | `FilterBuilderCondition` | the recursive ObjectQL predicate AST (`$and`/`$or`/`$not`)                     |
  | `components` | `Field`                      | `FieldContainer`         | an object FIELD's metadata and its builder namespace                           |
  | `react`      | `ConflictResolutionStrategy` | `ConflictResolution`     | the metadata-MERGE policy (`error \| priority \| first-wins \| last-wins`)     |

  The `react` rename is the odd one out: the new name is the **spec's own** name
  for the union that hook always used, so it is a re-export rather than a dialect.

  Eleven more keep their names and are now **imported or derived from the spec**
  instead of re-declared: `TenancyPosture`, `DelegableScope` (+`DelegableAdminScope`),
  `AuthUser`, `ShareLinkPermission`, `ShareLinkAudience`, `ShareLink`, `SortItem`,
  `OfflineStrategy`, `OfflineCacheConfig`, `OfflineSyncConfig`, `OfflineConfig`,
  `NavigationConfig`.

  **Three of the copies were losing information, not just duplicating it.**

  - `AuthUser` never declared the spec's `positions` or `tenantId` — the
    authorization inputs. Its `[key: string]: unknown` index signature meant the
    omission was invisible at every call site _and_ to any structural comparison
    (the objectstack#4075 mechanism). It now `extends` the spec principal, so the
    display-only fields (`image`, `role`, `roles`, `emailVerified`) are the delta
    and the spec's keys arrive on their own.
  - `useNavigationOverlay`'s copy carried the note _"inline … to avoid importing
    from `@object-ui/types` (which may not be a direct dependency of
    `@object-ui/react`)"_. The vocabulary belongs to `@objectstack/spec`, which
    **is** a direct dependency — the same expired "kept local to avoid a
    dependency" comment objectui#3169 found in `@object-ui/app-shell`.
  - `useOffline` and `usePerformance` both opened with _"Types aligned with
    `@objectstack/spec` v2.0.7"_. The installed spec is 17.0.0-rc.1.

  `ShareLink` derives from the spec row **minus `password_hash`** — omitted rather
  than optional, because it is the credential itself and typing it in a browser
  package is an invitation to render it. `password_protected` (the boolean the UI
  needs in its place) is the one local addition.

  The config types derive from each schema's **input** side, not `z.infer`.
  `useOffline(config: OfflineConfig = {})` defaults to the empty object, which the
  output type — every `.default()`ed key required — would reject outright.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/components`: its public type surface now references the spec.

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

- 726b89c: `@object-ui/types` stops declaring sixteen symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns (objectui#3156, objectstack#4115).

  Seven are now **derived** from the spec, nine are **renamed** to the local
  dialect they always were. Both halves remove the same hazard: a local
  declaration under a spec export's name reads as the spec's own definition to
  the next reader, so a copy that is merely _correct today_ is a planted premise
  tomorrow.

  **Derived** — the spec now supplies the keys, by reference:

  | symbol                   | derivation                                                                        |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ActionParam`            | `z.input<typeof ActionParamSchema>`, `type` widened to the local legacy spellings |
  | `CreateExportJobRequest` | `Omit<CreateExportJobInput, 'object'>` (`object` is the method argument)          |
  | `CreateExportJobResult`  | re-export from `@objectstack/spec/contracts`                                      |
  | `ImportRowResult`        | re-export from `@objectstack/spec/api`                                            |
  | `NavigationArea`         | spec keys, with `navigation` / `visible` pinned locally                           |
  | `NavigationAreaSchema`   | `specFieldsExcept(NavigationAreaSchema.shape, …)`                                 |
  | `Theme`                  | re-export of the spec's `ThemeInput` (the authoring shape)                        |
  | `ExportJobFormat`        | re-export of the spec's `ExportFormat`                                            |

  Four of these close real gaps rather than tidy names. `ActionParam` never
  declared `reference` — the key `resolveActionParams()` actually reads for an
  inline lookup target — nor `defaultFromRow`, which the metadata designer's own
  inspector writes; it also narrowed `visible` to a bare string although the
  resolver has always accepted the `{ dialect, source }` envelope too.
  `CreateExportJobResult.createdAt` and `ImportRowResult.action` were optional
  here and required by the server, leaving every consumer a branch that could
  never run. And `NavigationArea`'s `id` now carries the spec's own length rule
  instead of accepting any string.

  **Renamed** — same word, different concept:

  | was                | now                      | why                                                                                                                            |
  | :----------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `FileMetadata`     | `UploadedFileMetadata`   | field-VALUE payload (`url`, `original_name`), not the storage file record                                                      |
  | `GestureType`      | `TouchGestureType`       | direction-fused (`swipe-left`), not the spec's type+direction pair                                                             |
  | `GestureConfig`    | `TouchGestureConfig`     | gesture→`action` binding, not per-gesture tuning                                                                               |
  | `OfflineConfig`    | `PWAOfflineConfig`       | service-worker route caching, not the offline data/sync model                                                                  |
  | `PageRegion`       | `PageNodeRegion`         | region of the renderer page NODE, holding `SchemaNode`s                                                                        |
  | `PageRegionSchema` | `PageNodeRegionSchema`   | zod twin of the above                                                                                                          |
  | `ResponsiveConfig` | `MobileResponsiveConfig` | mobile box config, not the spec's SDUI grid contract                                                                           |
  | `WidgetManifest`   | `RuntimeWidgetManifest`  | SDUI component manifest, not the field-widget plugin manifest                                                                  |
  | `WidgetSource`     | `RuntimeWidgetSource`    | `module`/`inline`/`registry` loader union — and its `inline` carries a resolved component where the spec's carries source code |

  **Migration**: the old names are gone, not deprecated — an alias would preserve
  exactly the ambiguity being removed. Import the new name; nothing about the
  shapes changed. `@object-ui/types` already re-exports the spec's own
  `SpecResponsiveConfig`, and `@object-ui/react`'s `useOffline` config remains the
  spec-shaped `OfflineConfig`, so both concepts stay reachable under
  distinguishable names.

  Each rename carries a bidirectional tripwire
  (`packages/types/src/__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts`): it fails if
  the spec ever claims the new name, and also if the spec retires the old one —
  at which point the natural name can be taken back rather than the workaround
  outliving its reason.

### Patch Changes

- cb82705: A standalone grid's search box searches the list, not the page you can see (objectui#3118).

  Under server-side pagination a standalone `ObjectGrid` rendered `data-table`'s
  built-in search box, and that box filtered the rows the table was holding —
  which is one page. The user read "2 results for X in this list" while 3075 rows
  never participated, with the pager beside it still reading `1 / 63`. Every piece
  was individually correct: `searchable` defaults to true, `manualPagination` is
  true, and the two are declared next to each other in the same object literal.

  This is objectui#3106 one axis over — sort there, filter here — and it takes the
  same shape. `DataTable` gains `manualSearch` + a controlled `search` +
  `onSearchChange`. In that mode it filters nothing, reports the typed term, and
  renders `search` as the box's value, holding **no** term of its own: a private
  copy beside a controlled prop is the shape the defect had. `ObjectGrid` turns
  that term into a `$search` on the refetch — the server picks the matching fields
  from the object's metadata (ADR-0061), the same channel the ListView toolbar has
  always used — and returns to page 1, since a new term makes the old page index a
  different set of rows (usually no rows at all). `$searchFields` rides along only
  when the view declared `searchableFields`, which can narrow the server-resolved
  set and never widen it.

  Two things worth naming:

  - Both paths are never live at once. The server's answer is the answer; a client
    pass left running underneath would silently re-narrow it to whichever returned
    rows happen to contain the term as _rendered text_, overruling the server's
    own notion of which fields are searchable.
  - Under `manualSearch` a table with no `onSearchChange` renders **no** search
    box. The sort axis could degrade to inert headers; here there is no honest
    local behaviour to fall back to, because the rows to search are not in the
    browser.

  Client-paginated grids are untouched: inline, bound and grouped grids hold every
  row they display, so their box keeps filtering in memory, where the count it
  produces is true. The ListView path was never affected — it passes
  `showSearch: false` and searches from its own toolbar.

- f6e8d78: Lookup search inside a create/edit modal is typeable again (objectui#3183).

  In every production console build, the search input of a lookup field's
  quick-select popover — and the nested Record Picker dialog — could not take
  focus while the form modal was open: every click/focus was synchronously
  yanked back to the field trigger, so a lookup could not be searched while
  creating a record.

  Root cause is a race in stock `@radix-ui/react-focus-scope@1.1.16`: the
  focus-scopes stack effect's cleanup schedules `focusScopesStack.remove(scope)`
  in a `setTimeout(0)`. When the effect re-runs for a still-mounted scope (a
  `container` ref flicker), the re-run re-`add`s the scope and the stale timeout
  then evicts it — the dialog's trap listeners stay active but its scope is no
  longer in the stack, so an opening popover pauses nothing and the trap yanks
  focus out of the popover forever.

  Fixed via `patches/@radix-ui__react-focus-scope.patch`: an effect re-run for a
  live scope cancels the pending eviction; a real unmount still runs the full
  delayed cleanup (autofocus-on-unmount + stack removal). Regression-tested in
  `packages/components` with a deterministic reproduction of the race.

- a8ad6c0: A required boolean must be savable in its UNCHECKED state — `false` and `0` are values.

  Reported against an AI-built task tracker whose 任务 object has a required
  `是否完成` boolean: the create form showed the switch OFF, answered "是否完成不能
  为空", and saved instantly once the switch was turned ON. The app could only ever
  create ALREADY-DONE tasks — the one state the control shows by default was the
  one value it refused to save (cloud#972).

  Two defects stacked, and either alone is enough to break it:

  **The `required` verdict read truthiness, not presence.** `@objectstack/spec`
  FieldSchema.required (ADR-0113) is "an insert must provide a NON-NULL value",
  and objectql's record validator implements exactly that. react-hook-form's
  built-in rule instead fails whenever `isBoolean(value) && !value` — its
  accept-the-terms checkbox heritage — silently redefining every required boolean
  as "must be TRUE", including a select whose chosen option value is `false`. It
  also disagreed the other way, letting a whitespace-only string through for the
  server to reject with a 400. The form renderer no longer hands RHF its own
  `required`: the check is now a `validate` entry keyed `required` (so the error
  still surfaces as `type: 'required'`, which the conditional-required cleanup
  keys on) backed by a new shared `isMissingForRequired` in `@object-ui/core`, a
  deliberate mirror of objectql `record-validator.isMissing` — `undefined`,
  `null`, blank-after-trim string, empty array. Deleting the inherited rule also
  stops a `required` that rode in on `validation` from outliving a `requiredWhen`
  that resolved to FALSE.

  **A boolean field held `undefined` while displaying "off".** A two-state control
  has no third state, but a field with no entry in `defaultValues` rendered an OFF
  switch backed by nothing: the create payload omitted the column (it lands null,
  which reads as unchecked but isn't) and the presence check above would still
  refuse it. The form renderer now folds `false` into `defaultValues` for every
  boolean-widget field the caller left unset — in `defaultValues` itself, not
  per-Controller, because that object is also the dirty-check baseline and what
  the defaults-reset window replays. Every surface gets it, including the
  modal/drawer create dialogs that start from a bare `{}`. An authored default
  (or a loaded record, `null` included) still wins.

  `WizardForm`'s cross-step gate had its own copy of the empty-value predicate; it
  now imports the shared one so it cannot drift from the per-field verdict. And
  the field-demo renderer read `schema.defaultValue || schema.value`, throwing
  away an authored default of `false` / `0` / `''` — same falsy-as-empty class,
  now `??`.

  Verified end to end on a local stack against the exact metadata shape
  `apply_blueprint` materializes (`{ type: 'boolean', required: true }`, no
  default): a 是否完成 = 否 task with 工时 = 0 now creates and persists as
  `{ hours: 0, is_done: false }`, turning the switch on still stores `true`, and a
  blank required text is still refused.

## 17.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e7349e: **`target` is the only action handler slot — the `execute` alias is gone from the renderer (framework#3856).**

  `ActionRunner.executeScript` read `action.target || action.execute`. That fallback
  is unreachable against `@objectstack/spec` 17: `execute` is now a tombstoned key
  (framework#3855) that the parser **rejects** with the rename prescription, so no
  parsed action can carry it and the `||` could only ever yield `target`. Verified
  against 17.0.0-rc.0 — an action declaring `execute` fails `ActionSchema.safeParse`,
  and a `target` action's parsed output has no `execute` key at all.

  Deleted rather than left as harmless residue: two handler slots is what let one
  action run one script server-side and a different one client-side (framework#3713,
  where this renderer preferred the alias while the spec transform preferred
  `target`). A dead slot still reads as a live contract to the next maintainer.

  `execute` is also **removed from the types**, which is the part that had never
  landed. framework#3856 predicted a compile error here; there wasn't one, because
  neither reader was typed against the spec's `z.infer`:

  - `@object-ui/types` `ActionSchema` hand-declared `execute?: string`. Removed, so
    `execute: '…'` now fails `tsc` at the authoring site (TS2353).
  - `@object-ui/core` `ActionDef` hand-declared it too. Removed — but `ActionDef`
    carries a `[key: string]: any` index signature, so stale hand-authored metadata
    that never passed through the parser still compiles. For that path
    `executeScript` now returns the rename prescription instead of a bare
    "No script provided", matching the spec tombstone's rule that removing an
    authorable key must be audible: silently binding no handler is the
    "Mark Done does nothing" shape (framework#2169).

  The four action renderers (`action:button`, `action:icon`, `action:menu`,
  `action:group`) no longer forward `execute` into the runner, and Studio's
  `ActionPreview` no longer falls back to it — previewing an alias-only draft as
  "bound" contradicted the parse that rejects it on save.

  Requires `@objectstack/spec` 17. Metadata still on the alias is rewritten by
  `os migrate meta --from 16`.

- 38ca8be: refactor(fields): `requiredWhen` is the only required-predicate slot — drop the retired `conditionalRequired` alias

  `@objectstack/spec` 17 (objectstack#3855) **retired** `Field.conditionalRequired`,
  the long-deprecated alias of `requiredWhen`. ObjectUI carried a back-compat read
  for it in seven places; all of them are removed.

  The removal is safe because the spec did not merely _stop emitting_ the key — it
  made authoring it **fail loudly**. `retiredKey()` declares the key as
  `z.never()`, so:

  - `z.input` types it as `never` — writing it is a `tsc` error at the authoring site;
  - the parse **rejects** it (verified against `17.0.0-rc.0`), at both `FieldSchema`
    and `ObjectSchema`, with the prescription as the message:

    > `conditionalRequired` was removed in @objectstack/spec 17 (#3855) — use
    > `requiredWhen`. Rename the key; the value (a CEL predicate) is unchanged.
    > Run `os migrate meta --from 16` to rewrite it automatically.

  So spec-parsed metadata cannot carry the key — an object declaring it fails to
  load rather than loading with the rule silently dropped. Keeping a renderer-side
  `requiredWhen ?? conditionalRequired` would have re-created exactly the second
  de-facto contract the tombstone exists to prevent: the key would have kept
  working in the UI while being rejected everywhere else, hiding the producer's bug
  (AGENTS.md #0.1). "Backend-agnostic" (#1) does not argue for keeping it either —
  `conditionalRequired` is an ObjectStack-spec-ism, so the only producers that ever
  emit it are ObjectStack producers on ≤16, and the spec ships them a converter.

  Removed from:

  | `@object-ui/app-shell`   | the field inspector's legacy read/auto-migrate, and the key's entry in `clientValidation`'s CEL lint list |

  **Studio authors lose nothing.** The object designer's draft validation parses
  against the spec's own `ObjectSchema`, so a draft carrying the key now surfaces
  the tombstone's rename prescription under the same `fields.<name>.conditionalRequired`
  path the CEL lint used to report — a better message than the inspector's silent
  auto-migration, and one the server agrees with. That behavior is pinned by a test.

  **Migrating:** rename the key to `requiredWhen` (the CEL value is unchanged), or
  run `os migrate meta --from 16`.

- 07de839: fix(notifications): the config, `position` and action `variant` are read instead of forked or ignored (#3014 follow-up)

  The last of the notification contract. After `displayType` (#3071) and `icon`
  (#3076), four gaps of the same family were left:

  - **the config was 3/4 inert** — only `defaultDuration` was ever read.
    `maxVisible` and `stacking` were carried and ignored, while
    `NotificationBanners` capped at a hard-coded `3` of its own;
  - **its field names forked from `NotificationConfigSchema`** — `position` vs
    `defaultPosition`, a renderer-local `stacking` boolean with no spec
    counterpart, and no `pauseOnHover` at all;
  - **a notification could not declare a `position`.** The #3008 parity guard
    asserted the position _vocabulary_ matched the spec while nothing positioned
    anything by it — a guard passing over an unused value;
  - **`NotificationActionButton.variant` was the shadcn Button vocabulary**
    (`default | destructive | outline`) under a spec-shaped name, forking
    `NotificationActionSchema.variant` (`primary | secondary | link`).

  **How positioning resolves now** — `notification.position ?? config.defaultPosition
?? nothing`, and "nothing" is a real answer:

  - **declared** → the surface pins itself there, always. `presentNotificationToast`
    passes it per-toast so the contract wins over the container;
  - **undeclared** → the surface keeps its own anchor (a snackbar's bottom edge) or
    defers to the host's toast chrome.

  That asymmetry is the design decision. The host's sonner container also serves
  toasts that are _not_ spec notifications (the console action runtime's own
  `toast.*` calls), so it stays the fallback authority for placement — never a
  competing one. A declared position a component prop could silently override
  would be the same "validates, then does nothing" shape this whole area is about.
  Hence `defaultPosition` has no fabricated default: "the host didn't say" has to
  be representable.

  Also: `maxVisible` / `stackDirection` now drive every stacking surface through
  one shared `visibleNotificationStack` (cap keeps the NEWEST, stack grows in the
  declared direction); `pauseOnHover` holds a transient notification's timer and
  resumes it with the time it had left, which needed the provider to track live
  timers rather than fire-and-forget `setTimeout`s. Legacy spellings still resolve:
  `position` folds into `defaultPosition`, and `stacking: false` reads as
  `maxVisible: 1` rather than being ignored.

  `onToast` now receives the resolved config as a second argument, so the delegate
  can apply the parts of the contract only it can. Existing one-argument handlers
  are unaffected. The spec-parity guard gained the action-variant vocabulary, the
  one notification enum it did not cover.

- 2a40b5e: feat(notifications): each spec `displayType` gets its own presentation instead of a toast (#3014)

  #3008 closed the **contract** half of this: `NotificationContext`'s union matched
  `NotificationTypeSchema`, and `notify()` materialized the declared type so a
  consumer _could_ branch on it. Nothing did. `NotificationProvider` handed every
  item to the host's `onToast` delegate regardless of type, so an author picking
  `banner` or `inline` got a transient overlay — plausible output, wrong output.

  Each of the five spec types now has a presentation of its own:

  | `displayType` | Presentation                                           | Rendered by                        |
  | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
  | `toast`       | transient overlay (unchanged)                          | the host's `onToast` delegate      |
  | `snackbar`    | bottom-anchored bar, one at a time, at most one action | `<NotificationSnackbar />`         |
  | `banner`      | page-width strip **in the content flow**               | `<NotificationBanners />`          |
  | `alert`       | blocking acknowledgement dialog, FIFO queue            | `<NotificationAlerts />`           |
  | `inline`      | in place, at the raising surface                       | `<NotificationInline scope="…" />` |

  The four surface components ship from `@object-ui/components` and subscribe via
  `useNotificationsByPresentation(type, scope?)`.

  **Answers to the three questions the issue left open:**

  1. **Banner/inline placement is the host's.** They are not overlays: a banner takes
     space at the top of the content area and an `inline` notification belongs next to
     the thing that raised it. So the context exposes the items and the surfaces
     subscribe, rather than one `onToast`-style delegate positioning everything. An
     `inline` notification carries a `scope` that pairs it with its outlet, so two
     forms on one page don't show each other's messages.
  2. **`alert` is modal-ish but NOT the action system's `ModalHandler`.** That handler
     resolves a page/object, renders it, and reports an `ActionResult` back to the
     `ActionRunner`; a notification alert has no schema, no target and no result.
     Routing it there would mean synthesizing a page just to say "OK". It renders
     through the `AlertDialog` primitive instead — no second action-modal path.
  3. **`snackbar` earns its own component.** It supersedes rather than stacks, anchors
     bottom regardless of the toast position config, and takes at most one action.
     Making it a sonner variant is what "presents as a toast" means.

  **Also fixed:** auto-dismiss now follows the presentation. `toast`/`snackbar` keep
  the transient timer; `banner`/`alert`/`inline` are persistent unless the raiser sets
  `duration` explicitly — a persistent banner used to evaporate on the shared 5s toast
  timer. `dismissible` is honored on the persistent surfaces (an `alert` always keeps
  its acknowledge button; `dismissible: false` only closes the Escape route).

  `onToast` now receives **only** `toast` items. A provider with no `onToast` remains
  the supported store-only mode (a bell reading `notifications`/`unreadCount`), but
  raising one of the other four types with its surface unmounted warns in dev, naming
  the component to mount — that failure used to be silent.

  `NOTIFICATION_PRESENTATIONS` is typed `Record<NotificationPresentation, …>`, so a new
  member in the spec enum fails type-check until its presentation is decided; a parity
  test additionally asserts the table covers `NotificationTypeSchema` exactly and that
  no two types share a surface.

- df613fa: fix(notifications): the spec `icon` is read instead of stored and ignored (#3014 follow-up)

  `NotificationSchema.icon` — "Icon name override" — reached `NotificationItem` and
  stopped there. Every surface drew the severity icon, so an author writing
  `icon: 'rocket'` got the success checkmark. Same shape as the `displayType`
  collapse #3071 fixed: a value that validates, is carried, and renders nothing.

  All five presentations now resolve it through one rule (`notificationIcon`): a
  declared Lucide name — kebab-case or PascalCase — replaces the severity icon;
  anything else falls back to it. That includes the console's sonner toast, so the
  override behaves identically on a toast, a banner, a snackbar, an alert and an
  inline message.

  **The fallback is the interesting part.** `getLazyIcon` degrades an unknown name
  to a `Database` glyph, which is right for a data-shaped schema slot and wrong
  here — on an error notification it swaps a meaningful icon for a meaningless one.
  So the name is checked first, via a new `isLucideIconName` export, and a typo
  costs the author their override and nothing more.

- 0ded602: fix(form): a server rejection that names fields now marks those fields (objectstack#3896)

  The server has always said which field it rejected. `@objectstack/objectql`'s
  validators throw `VALIDATION_FAILED` with `fields[]` — one entry per offending
  field, each with a human `message` — and both the REST layer and the runtime
  dispatcher serve that as a 400 with the entries intact.

  Every form dropped them. The submit handler caught the rejection, ran the
  message through `extractWriteErrorMessage`, and showed **one undirected toast**:
  the user was told something was wrong but not _what_, on a surface that already
  knows how to mark an input — and already does exactly that for client-side
  validation. On a long form the offending field was often off-screen, so "创建"
  appeared to do nothing.

  **Now the two failures behave identically, because they share one
  implementation.** The per-field marking, the toast naming the fields, and the
  scroll-and-focus of the first offender (#2793) were extracted from the
  client-side invalid handler; the server path calls the same function. As far as
  the person filling in the form is concerned these are the same event — only the
  referee differs.

  Three layers, each of which was dropping the detail:

  - **`@object-ui/react`** — new `extractFieldErrors(err)` (exported alongside
    `extractWriteErrorMessage` / `isPermissionError`) normalises the three shapes
    the error can arrive in: a typed `ValidationError` from the ObjectStack
    adapter, the raw `@objectstack/client` error (whose `details` falls back to the
    whole response body, which is where `fields[]` lands), and a hand-rolled error
    carrying `fields` directly — the server duck-types that shape identically, so
    the client must not be pickier than the server. Entries with no usable `field`
    are **dropped rather than guessed at**: marking an innocent input is worse than
    the generic toast.
  - **`@object-ui/data-objectstack`** — `normaliseClientError` now maps a 400
    `VALIDATION_FAILED` onto the `ValidationError` class that has sat in
    `errors.ts` since the package was written, exported and **never once
    constructed**. Its `validationErrors: Array<{ field, message }>` shape was
    already exactly right. `create` also now normalises at all: only `update` did,
    so a rejected insert reached callers as the raw client error — and a create is
    the path that most often trips required-field validation.
  - **`@object-ui/components`** — the form renderer maps the entries onto
    `form.setError` and takes over the failure, **but only when every rejected
    field has a visible input to carry it**. If the server also rejected something
    the form does not render, it falls through to the banner, whose top-level
    message concatenates every field's reason — so the part the user cannot see
    inline is still said out loud instead of silently dropped.

  This also removes the need for the client-side predicate mirroring added in
  #2962: a form no longer has to guess what the server will reject in order to
  warn about it beforehand, and mirrored predicates drift.

  Non-field failures (403 / permission denials / anything without `fields[]`) take
  exactly the path they took before.

- 24e0e0a: feat(components,grid,list): a column-header sort orders the whole list, not the page you can see — #3106

  Clicking a column header under server pagination sorted **the current page**.
  The user saw "sorted by this column" and got "these fifty rows are in order;
  page 2 starts over". The sort was real — its scope was not the one the screen
  implied — and it had no way out of `data-table` at all: the sort lived in two
  `useState`s with no callback, so the layer that issues the request could not
  see it even in principle.

  `DataTable` gains `manualSorting` + a controlled `sort` + `onSortChange`. In
  that mode it sorts nothing, reports what a header click asks for, and renders
  `sort` as the indicator — keeping **no** sort state of its own, because a
  private copy beside a controlled prop is the shape the defect had.

  `ObjectGrid` turns that into a `$orderby` in both of its server modes (its own
  fetch, and a parent-driven one), and `ListView` lands it in `currentSort` — the
  same state the toolbar's sort builder writes. One sort, two controls: that is
  what makes "does a header sort outrank the saved view's sort?" a non-question
  rather than a precedence rule someone has to remember.

  Three details that are decisions, not incidentals:

  - **A header click replaces the order** instead of appending to it, so the
    column under the cursor is the one the list is sorted by. Multi-key orders
    still come from the sort builder, and the headers render them numbered.
  - **It cannot ask for "no sort".** In client mode the third click clears, and
    that is meaningful there — the rows return to the order they arrived in.
    Across a server-paged collection there is no such order (objectstack#4363), so
    a header offering it would hand the user a worse lie than the one being fixed.
    Clearing stays with the sort builder, which can restore the view's default.
  - **Relational columns render no sort affordance** under server sorting. A
    `lookup` column shows a related record's name while `$orderby` can only order
    by the stored id (objectstack#4256) — the same reason #3096 removed them from
    the toolbar's sort picker. Client-side sorting keys off the rendered label, so
    those headers stay live there.

  Client-side tables are untouched: same three-state cycle, same local sort.

- 80edbd4: fix(view,components): the spec→FilterBuilder operator table covers the whole view vocabulary, and the dead write direction is gone

  `view-config-utils`' `SPEC_TO_BUILDER_OP` resolved **10 of the spec's 19
  canonical `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS`**. The nine it missed —
  `not_equals`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `greater_than`, `less_than`,
  `greater_than_or_equal`, `less_than_or_equal`, `is_null`, `is_not_null` — all
  appear in stored view metadata (they are canonical; `ViewFilterRuleSchema`
  validates against exactly this list), and each reached the FilterBuilder as a
  raw spelling its operator dropdown cannot select.

  Same defect and same cause as #2974, one table over: spellings were enumerated
  by hand. That table is now derived from the spec's own canonical list and
  `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES`, matched case- and separator-insensitively, so
  `not_in` / `notIn` / `'not in'` / `NOT_IN` are one entry rather than four
  chances to miss one.

  Four canonical operators have no FilterBuilder equivalent —
  `starts_with`/`ends_with` (absent from its vocabulary) and `is_null`/
  `is_not_null` (distinct from the `is_empty`/`is_not_empty` it does have). They
  are recorded as explicit `null`s and asserted, and deliberately left unmapped:
  folding them onto a near-equivalent would silently rewrite the author's
  operator on the next save, whereas an unmapped operator surfaces as a condition
  row the author must complete.

  Also retired `BUILDER_TO_SPEC_OP` and `toSpecFilter` — the write direction,
  dead since the legacy `buildViewConfigSchema` engine was replaced by the
  studio's spec-driven inspector (no caller anywhere in the repo, and not part of
  `@object-ui/plugin-view`'s public exports). It was objectui's last emitter of
  `'not in'` with a space, plus `before`/`after`, as _filter-AST_ operators —
  spellings that reached the server outside `VALID_AST_OPERATORS` and were dropped
  without an error (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3948).

  `@object-ui/components` now exports `FILTER_BUILDER_OPERATORS` (and the
  `FilterBuilderOperator` type), derived from the operators the FilterBuilder
  actually renders, so tables mapping onto that vocabulary can assert against it
  instead of restating it.

  Refs objectstack-ai/objectui#2945, #2901.

### Patch Changes

- fc0272a: fix(actions): apply the ADR-0066 D4 capability gate on every action surface (framework#3923)

  An action declaring `requiredPermissions` is supposed to be one declaration with
  two enforcement surfaces: 403 on the server, hidden button in the UI. The UI half
  only ever ran inside `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` — and the surfaces
  `record_header`, `record_more`, `list_item` and `list_toolbar` actually render on
  do not go through the engine. They filter their own action lists. So a button
  declaring a capability nobody holds rendered, live and clickable, on the record
  header, in every grid row menu, and on the list toolbar. For a `type: 'api'`
  action pointed at a self-authored endpoint, nothing else was checking either: the
  platform's action route (which is where the 403 comes from) never sees that
  request.

  `page:header`, `action:bar` (business _and_ `systemActions`) and the grid's
  `RowActionMenu` now apply the same gate, via a shared `useCapabilityGate()` so
  the surfaces cannot drift apart. The rule is the engine's, unchanged: hide unless
  the caller holds **all** declared capabilities; an empty held set is "holds
  nothing" and gates; **unknown** — no action runtime, no resolved capabilities —
  fails OPEN, because the server is the authority and hiding a permitted user's
  button on missing client data is the worse failure.

  The record surface was also feeding the gate nothing to work with.
  `RecordDetailView` mounts its own `<ActionProvider>`, which shadows the shell's
  for every action on that page, and seeded it with identity only — no
  `systemPermissions`. Since unknown fails open, that alone un-gated every
  `record_header` / `record_more` / `record_section` action on the one page those
  locations exist on. It now forwards the caller's resolved capabilities (and only
  once they have actually resolved, so a standalone embed without a
  `PermissionProvider` keeps failing open rather than hiding everything).

  `useRecordEditable`'s record-level explain probe went out on a bare
  `fetch(..., { credentials: 'include' })`. A bearer-token session carries its
  credential in the `Authorization` header, not a cookie, so the probe came back
  401 on a perfectly valid admin session and the verdict silently failed open —
  the hook was inert in exactly the deployments it was written for. It now rides
  the host's authenticated fetch (`SchemaRendererProvider`'s `apiFetch`), falling
  back to the global one for standalone embeds.

- c785740: fix(detail): record Attachments become their own tab (with count badge) and their copy is translated — objectstack#4358

  Two defects on `enable.files: true` record detail pages:

  1. **Buried placement.** `RecordDetailView` appended `RecordAttachmentsPanel`
     AFTER the schema-rendered page tree, whose synthesized default embeds
     `record:discussion` as the last main component — so the panel always
     landed below an ever-growing feed timeline, undiscoverable without
     scrolling to the very bottom, with no metadata knob to move it.

     `buildDefaultTabs` now emits a peer **Attachments** tab (a new
     `record:attachments` node rendered by an app-shell registration wrapping
     the existing panel via RecordContext) between Related and
     Activity/History. `PageTabsRenderer` derives the tab's count badge from a
     `sys_attachment` probe scoped to `(parent_object, parent_id)`, riding the
     same RelatedCountStore cache/invalidation bus as related-list badges — so
     uploads and deletes update the badge live. A `hideAttachments` synthesizer
     option suppresses the tab; RecordDetailView keeps its legacy bottom append
     only as the fallback for authored pages without the node
     (`hasExplicitAttachments`).

  2. **Untranslated copy.** The panel's eleven `detail.*` keys (`attachments`,
     `uploadAttachment`, `loadingAttachments`, `noAttachments`,
     `downloadAttachment`, `deleteAttachment`, and the five
     `attachment*Denied/Required` friendly errors) existed only as inline
     English `defaultValue`s — no locale bundle carried them, so non-English
     consoles always showed English. All ten locales now define them; the tab
     label rides the existing well-known-label dictionary (→ 附件 etc.).

- b41f401: **Authoring types are input types (framework#4074 steps 2–3): `ActionParam` takes the spec's declaration forms, `ListViewSchema` stops promising parse-output defaults, and `FormField.dependsOn` matches its runtime reader.**

  Three public types said something different from what the platform accepts. All
  three divergences were found by making `packages/types`' tests compile (#3009)
  and then resolving the declared `p1-spec-alignment.test.ts` debt site-by-site
  instead of papering over it.

  **`ActionParam` is now the authoring shape, aligned with the spec's input.**
  `name` / `label` / `type` become optional and `field` / `objectOverride` appear:
  the spec's primary way to declare a param — a bare field reference that inherits
  label/type/validation/options from an object field — was unrepresentable while
  all three were required. The _resolved_ shape the dialog consumes (after
  app-shell's `resolveActionParams()` inlines the reference) remains
  `@object-ui/core`'s `ActionParamDef`, with all three required. Authoring and
  resolved are different types on purpose. `label` and option labels take the
  spec's `I18nLabel` by import — which the new compile-time guard promptly
  revealed to be aliased to plain `string` in the current spec (the per-locale
  record is the separate `I18nObject`), so this is not a behavioural widening
  today; importing the alias means objectui tracks any future widening
  automatically.

  **Breaking:** code destructuring `param.name` / `param.label` / `param.type` as
  guaranteed must now handle the field-backed form (or consume the resolved
  `ActionParamDef` instead, which is what dialog-side code should be doing).

  **`ListViewInferred` is `z.input`, not `z.infer`.** The spec sub-schemas that
  flow into the list-view surface (`userActions`, `tabs` → `ViewTab`, `sharing`)
  carry `.default()`s, so the inferred output type made fields like
  `userActions.refresh` or a tab's `pinned`/`visible` _required_ — but nothing on
  the render path ever runs `.parse()`: `normalizeListViewSchema` deliberately
  applies no defaults ("an absent flag stays absent", its own suite). The output
  type therefore rejected valid authored metadata (`userActions: { sort: true }`)
  while promising renderers defaults that never arrive. Typing the surface as
  input matches both the author and the runtime object. Code that _trusted_ those
  phantom defaults now gets an optionality error — which is a latent bug surfacing,
  not a regression: the value really could be absent.

  **`FormField.dependsOn` is `DependsOnInput`.** The runtime reader
  (`resolveCascadingOptions`) has always accepted a bare name, a list of names, or
  lookup-parameter entries `{ field, param }` — its parameter type says so. The
  public property said `string`, so array-authored metadata type-errored while
  working, and the form renderer read the key through `(f as any).dependsOn` to
  get past its own type. The shape now lives in `@object-ui/types` (single source
  of truth next to `FormField`), `@object-ui/core` imports and re-exports it, and
  the two `as any` reads in the components form renderer are typed.

  **The `p1-spec-alignment.test.ts` exclusion is gone.** Its 14 errors resolved:
  the two "sharing in ObjectUI format" tests and the legacy-ARIA-spelling fixture
  are deleted/rewritten — those dialects are _normalizer input_, folded by
  `normalizeListViewSchema` and asserted branch-by-branch in core's
  `normalize-list-view.test.ts`, the seam where the fold actually runs; asserting
  them on the canonical type only ever "passed" because nothing compiled the file.
  One fixture claimed a shape no surface ever admitted (an ObjectQL triplet as a
  spec `ViewTab.filter`) and was corrected to the rule-object form. Every test
  file in `@object-ui/types` is now compiled, with no exclusions.

  Discrimination-checked: reverting `ListViewInferred` to `z.infer`, `dependsOn`
  to `string`, or `ActionParam.name` to required each produces the expected
  compile error in the now-compiled test files (`TS2739` / `TS2322` / `TS2741`);
  restored, all projects are clean.

- 68ef584: fix(test-setup): stop shadowing ten real registrations, and declare page:header's inputs

  `vitest.setup.dom.tsx` re-registered `text`, `email`, `password`, `textarea`,
  `image`, `html`, `avatar`, `select`, `slider` and `grid` by hand — ~380 lines of
  renderer copied out of @object-ui/components — to undo bare-name fallbacks that
  @object-ui/fields and the plugins claimed by loading after it.

  Both sides now register under their own namespace with `skipFallback: true`, so
  nothing overwrites the `ui:` originals and the workaround is obsolete. It was
  not free: the copies carried no `inputs` and no `defaultProps`, so inside the
  test environment four curated public blocks reported an empty configuration
  surface while the real registrations declare one. `apps/console`'s contract
  test reads that registry, so its picture of the contract was fiction for those
  tags — a guard that measures a fixture instead of the product.

  Deleting the block restores what the app actually boots with. Verified: the ten
  tags keep their namespace and canonical type, and their declared surface comes
  back — `text` 1 input, `email` 6, `password` 6, `textarea` 6, `image` 3,
  `html` 1, `avatar` 4, `select` 6, `slider` 5, `grid` 7, plus `defaultProps`.
  The heavy DOM setup also got roughly twice as fast (~545s to ~235s of setup
  time across the suite), since every file in that project was paying to evaluate
  the duplicated renderers.

  With the shadowing gone, `page:header` was left as a genuine gap: a curated
  public block whose renderer reads `title`, `subtitle`, `actions`, `breadcrumb`,
  `recordChrome`, `showStar` and `showCopyId`, with none of them declared. Now
  declared.

  `element:divider` keeps zero inputs on purpose — its renderer reads only
  `className`, so there is nothing to author.

- c769d3d: fix(form): a `defaultValues` change no longer discards the field the user is filling

  The form renderer adopts a changed `defaultValues` with `form.reset()`, which
  replaces the **whole** react-hook-form record — so it also blanks the fields the
  incoming defaults say nothing about. And it runs in a **passive effect**, one
  commit after those fields have been committed and painted, so input landing in
  that window was silently dropped.

  The caught case is the wizard (objectui#2982). It reuses ONE inner form across
  steps and feeds it `defaultValues={formData}` — the merge of the steps submitted
  **so far** — so at every step boundary the incoming defaults are missing exactly
  the fields now on screen:

  ```
  RESET to {"name":"Alice"}   (values before: {"name":"Alice","note":"hello"})
  -> create POST {"name":"Alice"}   — the last step is gone
  ```

  In a browser this needs a busy main thread plus typing on the first frame after
  the new defaults arrive — unlikely by hand, but paste and autofill land in a
  single tick. The same shape had already bitten once before, as a `reset()` on
  `defaultValues` **identity** churn wiping input mid-interaction; comparing by
  value fixed that, and this is the residual hole where the value genuinely did
  change.

  The reset now carries such a value across instead of dropping it. Deliberately
  narrow: only a field the **caller has never carried** — absent from both the
  outgoing and the incoming defaults — and whose value the user actually changed
  is eligible. Wherever the caller has an opinion it stays authoritative, so the
  load-bearing paths are unchanged:

  - an edit-mode record landing after first paint still fills every field it names
    (a field the user has NOT touched is empty-ish against the baseline, using the
    same comparison the dirty check uses, so a widget normalizing its own empty
    value on mount is not mistaken for input);
  - a `recordId` swap still replaces the record outright — drawer/modal/split
    forms re-fetch without re-entering their loading branch, so record B lands in
    the still-mounted form and must not inherit an abandoned edit to record A;
  - a field the caller withdraws from its defaults stops being the user's.

  A reset that carries input now also reports the form as dirty (it is, against
  the caller's defaults) instead of unconditionally announcing pristine, so a
  host's discard guard keeps hearing the truth.

- 94e63ef: fix(form): the runtime `field` metadata slot is declared instead of smuggled, and importing the spec's FormField is a lint error — #3090

  `FormField.field` — the slot where object-bound form paths stash the resolved
  field-metadata **object** for widgets — rode through the index signature,
  undeclared, readable only via `as any`. Same key, different layer: in the spec
  form-view vocabulary `field` is a _string_ (the referenced object-field name),
  and the undeclared slot kept that pun latent. The slot is now declared
  (`field?: Record<string, any>`) with the invariant in its JSDoc: on a runtime
  FormField it is never a string — the authored string form ends at the
  `normalizeSectionField` chokepoint, and a tripwire test pins that across all
  three input shapes. Assigning a string is now a compile error; the `as any`
  casts at the read sites are gone.

  A `no-restricted-imports` tripwire bans importing `FormField`/
  `FormFieldSchema` from `@objectstack/spec/ui` inside this repo: the spec's
  FormField TYPE erases to `any` in its dist (objectstack#4171), so the
  misimport silently deletes type safety — tsc says nothing. The lint message
  names the two layers and the correct import. The drift-guard parity test is
  the one legitimate importer, exempted inline with its reason.

  Ledger: `FormField` and `FormFieldSchema` move from untriaged DEBT to ALLOW
  with the two-layer rationale written down (122 → 120).

- c735bf7: fix(form): a spec-vocabulary field no longer crashes the standalone form, and every surface now says which vocabulary you meant — #3090

  Writing the regression test against the unfixed renderer proved the failure
  was worse than the assumed silent drop: a `{ field: 'x' }` entry (spec
  form-VIEW vocabulary) slipped past the `f?.name` guards into a
  react-hook-form Controller with `name === undefined` and crashed the whole
  standalone form on `name.split('.')`, with nothing naming the culprit entry.
  The renderer now partitions such entries out — the rest of the form renders —
  and surfaces them with an inline alert plus a console.error whose text is the
  fix instruction (rename to `name`, or use an object-bound form whose sections
  accept the spec shape).

  `objectui validate` grows the same boundary awareness: on failure, a
  `{ field: … }` entry in a standalone form gets a "likely cause" hint naming
  the real fix instead of the bare `invalid_union` — the previous message read
  as "bolt a `name` on", which converts spec metadata wrongly. On success,
  mixed-vocabulary entries (`name` + string `field`) get a warning: they
  validate, but the spec key is dead weight the renderer ignores.

  `normalizeSectionField` warns (once per site) when an authored section field
  mixes both identity keys — the spec branch derives the runtime name from
  `field`, so an authored `name` was silently overwritten.

- 02aef0c: fix(sdui): a `kind:'html'` page can use lazily-registered blocks, and recovers when one registers late

  objectui#2953 had a twin one tier over, unreported. The whitelist a
  `kind:'html'` page's source compiles against was built from `getAllTypes()` +
  `getConfig()` — both loaded-only — so any block registered via `registerLazy()`
  was rejected as _"not an allowed component"_.

  The blast radius is worse than the react tier's. There, a missing block cost one
  identifier; here a compile diagnostic fails the **whole page**, so a single
  `<object-kanban>` replaced the entire page with `HTML page failed to compile (2)`.
  And it never recovered: `layoutElement` was memoised on `[schema, pageType]` with
  no registry signal, so the cached error panel outlived the plugin actually
  landing — permanently broken for the session.

  `ComponentRegistry` gains three lazy-aware reads:

  - `getKnownTypes()` — loaded registrations **plus** pending lazy stubs, deduped.
    The set a whitelist or manifest should be built from. `getAllTypes()` keeps its
    loaded-only meaning ("what can render right now") and now says so.
  - `getMeta(type, namespace?)` — metadata from the loaded registration, else from
    a pending stub. `getConfig()` stays loaded-only, since callers read
    `.component` off it.
  - `getVersion()` — monotonic counter of changes to the known set, bumped on
    register / unregister / registerLazy. A cache key that a type _count_ cannot
    substitute for: one registration plus one unregistration leaves the count
    untouched while the set changed.

  `getJsxManifest()` builds from those, and `PageRenderer` subscribes to the
  registry so a page that could not compile retries when the registry grows.

  A stub carries no `inputs` yet, so its props surface as `unknown-prop` warnings
  rather than errors — the page compiles and renders, and the inner
  `SchemaRenderer` triggers the loader and swaps in the real block. Authoring-time
  prop validation is unaffected: `sdui.manifest.json` is generated with every
  plugin eagerly loaded, and asserts as much.

- 9a04d25: fix(registry): prefix every namespaced key exactly once, in every namespace

  objectui#3023 fixed eleven `record:*` blocks registered as
  `register('record:x', …, { namespace: 'record' })` — an already-prefixed name
  handed to a registry that prefixes it again, landing the block at
  `record:record:x` — and guarded that namespace alone. Twenty-two more were
  sitting in `action:` (5), `element:` (10) and `page:` (7), two of them
  (`page:header`, `element:divider`) curated public blocks.

  Checking one namespace is exactly what let them keep sitting there, so the
  guard now asks the whole registry rather than a prefix of it.

  Same fix as before: register the bare name and let `namespace` do the
  prefixing, with `skipFallback: true` so the fallback does not claim that bare
  name globally. It would otherwise take over `header`, `footer`, `sidebar`,
  `tabs`, `card`, `accordion`, `section`, `text`, `image`, `button`, `icon` —
  every one of which belongs to `ui:`. All 22 stay reachable exactly as
  `<namespace>:<name>`; the registry goes 522 keys to 500, and the contract is
  unchanged at 42/42.

  Found while probing why six curated Tier B primitives report no `inputs`. They
  do declare them — `vitest.setup.dom.tsx` registers simplified `text` / `image` /
  `html` / `grid` stubs that shadow the real registrations inside the test
  environment only. That shadowing is a separate question, left alone here; the
  doubled keys it turned up are not test-environment artifacts.

- eb4b740: feat(page,element): declare inputs for the eight configurable page:\* / element:\* blocks

  Same gap objectui#3027 closed for `record:*`, in the two namespaces next door:
  renderers that read real props while every authoring surface reported "takes no
  configuration". Declarations mirror what each renderer reads —

  | block                     | inputs                                                                           |
  | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `page:tabs`               | items, tabStyle (line/card/pill), position (top/left)                            |
  | `page:card`               | title, bordered, body (slot), footer (slot)                                      |
  | `page:accordion`          | items, allowMultiple, variant (flush/card)                                       |
  | `element:text`            | content, variant (heading/subheading/body/caption), align                        |
  | `element:number`          | object, aggregate (count/sum/avg/min/max), field, filter, format, prefix, suffix |
  | `element:button`          | label, action (inline ActionDef), variant, size, icon, iconPosition, disabled    |
  | `element:definition-list` | items, columns, inline                                                           |
  | `element:repeater`        | object, titleField, fields, filter, sort, limit, emptyText, divided              |

  `page:section`, `page:footer` and `page:sidebar` are left at zero inputs on
  purpose: their renderers render `children`/`body` and nothing else — like
  `element:divider`, they are genuinely prop-less containers, and inventing
  inputs for them would be the opposite falsehood.

  `aria` and `className` stay undeclared throughout, per the convention on
  `record:details`: escape hatches and styling pass-throughs, not authoring
  choices. `element:button`'s registration also documents the split against
  `action:button` — inline ActionDef vs a declared action referenced by name —
  so the two stop reading as duplicates.

  Declaration only; no renderer behavior changes. Curation (which of these join
  `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`) is a separate change.

- 5b084eb: fix(sdui): the react page's "no adapter yet" fallback stops churning its provider context

  Audit of the remaining half of `ReactKindPage`'s scope memo, `[schema, adapter]`.
  The `schema` half was the live bug fixed in objectui#2984; this is the adapter
  half.

  **The hosts are fine.** Both `AdapterCtx.Provider` call sites pass a stable
  value — `AdapterProvider` from `useState`, the console preview from a module
  constant — so there is no state loss in the shipped app.

  **One real instance remained**, one layer down: `<SchemaRendererProvider
dataSource={adapter ?? {}}>` minted a fresh object on every render while the
  adapter was still null (the window before the host connects). That is a context
  value, and `SchemaRendererProvider` memoises on its identity, so every block
  inside the page had its schema re-cloned and its expressions re-run on each
  render of the page. Now a module constant, like the `SchemaRenderer` fallback
  it mirrors.

  **The `adapter` dependency itself must stay**, and is now pinned. It looks like
  the obvious thing to optimise away — it is the last remaining trigger that can
  recompile a page and cost its `useState`. But `ReactRunner` hands React the same
  element object while `(code, scope)` hold, and React bails out on an identical
  element reference, so the page subtree never re-renders on its own: recompiling
  is the _only_ path by which a new adapter reaches the blocks inside the page.
  Removing the dependency strands every block on the first adapter forever — no
  error, just a dead data source. `react-page-adapter.test.tsx` pins both
  directions, so the tradeoff cannot be quietly re-litigated.

  Docs: the react-pages guide now states the host-side requirement — an adapter
  constructed inline on every render resets every react page on every render.

- aa1240a: fix(sdui): lazily-registered public blocks reach a `kind:'react'` page's scope, and ReactRunner keeps the errors it catches

  Two defects in the trusted `kind:'react'` page tier.

  **objectui#2953 — the contract skipped lazy blocks.** `getPublicConfigs()`
  resolved every curated `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` tag through `getConfig()`, which reads
  loaded registrations only, so a block registered with `registerLazy()` was
  absent from the contract until its plugin chunk happened to be imported. In
  `apps/console` that silently dropped `object-kanban`, `object-calendar`,
  `object-gantt`, `object-timeline`, `object-map` and `markdown` from every react
  page's scope — writing `<ObjectKanban/>` threw `ReferenceError` even though the
  tag is a first-class contract member, and whether it threw depended on load
  order. `getPublicConfigs()` now resolves pending lazy stubs too, returning them
  with `lazy: true` and no `component` (new `PublicComponentConfig` type); the
  injected wrapper renders through `SchemaRenderer`, which triggers the loader and
  shows its placeholder. `getConfig()` stays loaded-only by design.

  **objectui#2954 — ReactRunner discarded its own error state.**
  `getDerivedStateFromProps` re-transpiled and re-evaluated the page source on
  every render and unconditionally set `error: null`. React runs it before the
  re-render that follows `getDerivedStateFromError`, so the boundary threw away
  the error it had just caught, rebuilt an identical throwing element, and the
  throw escaped past its own `fallback` to the renderer's generic panel; `onError`
  was gated on state that had already been cleared and never fired for a
  compile-time error at all; and each compile minted a fresh page function — a new
  element type — that remounted the subtree and wiped the page's `useState`. The
  transpile+eval is now memoised on `(code, scope)`, errors persist until the
  inputs actually change, and `onError` reports each error exactly once.

- 2374a49: fix(sdui): a react page no longer loses its state to a memo that never held, and a source that exports nothing fails loudly

  Writing the regression guard for objectui#2954's "latent hazard" found it was
  already real.

  **`evaluatedSchema` was memoised on values rebuilt every render.**
  `SchemaRenderer` fell back to a fresh `{}` when no `SchemaRendererProvider` sat
  above it, and `usePageVariables()` returned a brand-new object literal outside a
  `PageVariablesProvider`. Both feed the `evaluatedSchema` memo's dependency list,
  so for any tree without those providers the memo never hit: the schema was
  re-cloned and the ExpressionEvaluator re-run on every render, and children got a
  new schema identity every time. A `kind:'react'` page memoises its compiled
  source on that identity, so the page was recompiled — a new page function, a new
  element type — and React remounted it, silently discarding the user's `useState`.
  Any registry notification (every lazy plugin's first load) triggered it. Both
  fallbacks are now module constants.

  **A source that exports nothing now throws instead of rendering blank.**
  `generateElement` inserts the implicit `export default` only when the source
  _starts with_ JSX, a `function` declaration, `()` or `class` — so the very
  common `const Page = () => …` exported nothing, and the page rendered blank with
  no error reported anywhere. It now throws with a message naming the fix, which
  `ReactRunner`'s error panel surfaces. `export default null` still means "render
  nothing"; a default export that is not a component throws too.

  **`PageSchema['kind']` matches `@objectstack/spec`.** It declared
  `'full' | 'slotted'` while the renderer had shipped `'react'` and
  `'html'`/`'jsx'` since ADR-0080 and read the field through a cast. The union now
  spells all five and the cast is gone.

  Docs: new `content/docs/guide/react-pages.md` (choosing between the executed and
  parsed tiers, the capability gate, the injected scope, flat props, `Block`,
  `useAdapter`, source shapes, error handling) and a `@object-ui/react-runtime`
  README — the package had neither, while being the tier AI-authored pages target.

- 2d5d594: fix(list,detail): sorting a lookup column no longer orders by an invisible key — #3096

  A relational column (`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`) never holds
  the string its cell shows: it holds the `$expand`-ed record, or a raw foreign-key
  id whose label was resolved separately. Every sort path took that raw value as
  its key, so the column of names came back in an order with no relation to the
  names — sorting looked broken, with nothing saying the key was something else.

  The two halves are fixed differently, because they can order by different things:

  - **Client-side sorts** (grid column headers, any `data-table`, a non-windowed
    related list) now key off the label the cell renders, via the new
    `getSortValue` / `compareSortValues` in `@object-ui/core` — which resolves an
    expanded record through `getRecordDisplayName` (ADR-0079), so the sort key and
    the lookup cell agree on which field names a record. This replaces two broken
    comparators: `a[col] < b[col]` is always false between two objects (the
    comparator collapsed to a constant and permuted the rows), and
    `String(a[col])` is `"[object Object]"` (every row compared equal, so the sort
    silently did nothing).
  - **Server `$orderby` sorts** cannot be fixed here — the key is the stored id by
    construction, and `objectstack#4256` settled that no relation join is coming.
    So those entry points stop offering the illusion: the ListView toolbar sort
    picker withholds relational fields and explains why (pointing at a formula
    field as the supported way to sort by a related name), and a windowed related
    list renders no sort button for them.

  A relational field the view's CURRENT sort already uses stays listed, labelled
  `(by ID)`, so view metadata authored or saved with such a sort round-trips
  instead of rendering a blank row and losing the sort on the next edit.

- 379728f: fix(fields): a `select` no longer wipes itself when its value outruns its options (#2968)

  Radix keeps a hidden native `<select>` mirror so a Select's value takes part in
  native form submission. Assigning a value that mirror has no `<option>` for is a
  no-op — the element stays on `''` — but Radix still dispatches the synthetic
  `change`, so `''` comes straight back out through `onValueChange` and lands in
  react-hook-form on top of the value the caller just set.

  The window is not theoretical: `SelectContent` registers its native options a
  commit AFTER the trigger mounts, so a record that lands after first paint — an
  edit modal whose `findOne` is still in flight — resets the form into exactly
  that gap. Every rendered select came back empty while RHF's `_defaultValues`
  still held the right value. When one of the wiped fields is the one a
  `visibleWhen` predicate reads, the predicate flips back to false, the
  conditional fields hide again and the form **latches** in the broken state:
  pressing Update then fails validation, or submits an empty enum, on a form the
  user never touched. The wipe is also recorded as a user edit, so Cancel prompts
  "discard changes?" on an untouched form.

  `SelectItem` rejects `value=""` outright, so `''` can never be a value the user
  actually picked — it is always the mirror talking. It is now dropped at the
  single `Select` chokepoint, which covers every surface that renders one (object
  form, inline grid editor, action param dialog). Clearing a select still goes
  through `undefined`, which is untouched — the `dependsOn` cascade-clear behaves
  exactly as before.

- 7f23cd0: fix(form): a numeric/boolean select option survives selection with its type intact — #3090

  `SelectOptionSchema.value` has accepted `string | number | boolean` for as
  long as it has existed, but the Radix controls underneath speak strings:
  picking `{ value: 2 }` silently submitted `"2"` — a wrong-typed write into a
  number field that nothing on the client ever reported. (Display half-worked:
  a numeric default matched its numeric item; only SELECTION morphed the type.)

  The renderers now stringify on the way into the control and map the selection
  back to the AUTHORED option value on the way out (`matchOptionValue`), across
  the in-form select, the standalone `type: 'select'` component, and the
  standalone `type: 'radio-group'` component. The TS types stop lying to match:
  `SelectOption.value` / `RadioOption.value` and the corresponding
  `value`/`defaultValue`/`onChange` channels widen to what the zod schemas
  always accepted — a call site treating `option.value` as `string` is now a
  compile error pointing at a real latent crash, not a false comfort.

  The ripple the widening named, handled at each boundary: `@object-ui/core`'s
  `OptionLike.value` widens (the option engines compare by identity, so values
  flow opaquely; the option-lint's CEL-literal domain stringifies at its
  boundary), and the multi-value field widgets (checkboxes / multiselect /
  radio) stringify at theirs — multi-value fields store string arrays.

  Round-trip pinned by real Radix interactions in jsdom: the in-form select
  submits `2` (number), the standalone select hands its handler `false`
  (boolean).

- aa35561: fix(form): a split create/edit form no longer loses the panel you are not submitting from (#2153)

  `SplitForm` rendered one `SchemaRenderer` — one react-hook-form instance and one
  `<form>` element — **per section**, and its two groups of sections live in
  separate resizable panels. So each panel owned isolated form state: submitting
  from one panel's action bar sent only that section's fields and silently dropped
  everything the user had typed on the other side of the divider. Filling both
  panels and clicking Create persisted `{ subject }` alone.

  The same isolation killed cross-panel field rules: a `visibleWhen` in the right
  panel referencing a left-panel field never saw that field in its record, so the
  predicate faulted and failed **open** — the field the author meant to hide was
  always shown.

  Both panels are now ONE form. The panel group became a layout the form renderer
  owns, via a new `FormSchema.fieldPanes` (+ `fieldPanesOrientation`,
  `fieldPanesResizable`) that mirrors `fieldTabs` (#2959): the `<form>` wraps the
  whole `ResizablePanelGroup` and each pane holds only fields, which is what lets a
  single react-hook-form instance span the divider. Sections inside a pane render
  behind the inline `section-divider` header, each at its own declared column
  density within the form's shared grid.

  One more fix falls out of moving the panels into the renderer: `splitResizable:
false` now actually pins the divider. It previously only hid the grip — the
  separator stayed draggable, because nothing passed the panel library's
  `disabled`.

  Each pane is its own `@container`, so a multi-column section collapses to fewer
  columns as its panel is dragged narrower instead of overflowing.

- 3c1f321: fix(form): a tabbed/sectioned create-edit form no longer loses the tabs you are not looking at (#2959, #2153)

  The explicit-`sections` path rendered one `SchemaRenderer` — one react-hook-form
  instance and one `<form>` element — **per section**, all sharing the same
  `formId`. Two failures compounded:

  1. the footer submit button (`form={formId}`) can only be associated with the
     **first** of those forms, so section 2+ never reached the payload; and
  2. in the `tabbed` variant Radix unmounted the inactive panel, destroying that
     tab's form state outright.

  Reported flow (HotCRM, 3 tabs, required `description` on tab 3): fill tab 1 →
  submit → server 400 `description is required` → switch to tab 3, fill it →
  submit → the server now reports `subject; description; status; priority` **all**
  missing, because the second submit's body had lost every earlier value.

  `ModalForm` (stacked and `contentLayout: 'tabbed'`) and `TabbedForm` now render
  ONE form for all sections, matching `ObjectForm` / `DrawerForm`. Stacked sections
  use the existing inline `section-divider` header (which now also renders the
  section's `description`); tabbed sections go through a new
  `FormSchema.fieldTabs` (+ `defaultFieldTab`, `fieldTabsPosition`) that the form
  renderer distributes into **force-mounted** Radix panels — CSS-hidden rather
  than unmounted, since react-hook-form skips validation for unmounted fields,
  which is how a required field on a tab nobody opened used to sail past the
  client and come back as a server 400.

  Validation feedback now points at the tab: a rejected field activates its tab and
  every tab holding one is marked on its trigger, for client-side rules and server
  `fields[]` rejections alike.

### Patch Changes

- 7b21891: fix(action): honor the spec `disabled` predicate on every action-rendering surface (#1885 follow-through)

  The spec Action field is `disabled` (boolean | CEL — disabled when TRUE); the
  schema has no `enabled` key. #1885 wired it in `action:button` only. Browser
  dogfooding against the showcase found FIVE more surfaces where a spec-authored
  `disabled` silently did nothing:

  - **components** — the `action:group` leaves (inline + dropdown), `action:icon`
    and `action:menu` still read the legacy non-spec `enabled`. They now consume
    `disabled` as the primary control (evaluated in the same scope as `visible`),
    with `enabled` kept as a deprecated fallback.
  - **app-shell** — `DeclaredActionsBar` (server-declared action bar) read
    neither; it gains `disabled` (no legacy fallback: declared actions are
    spec-shaped and never carried `enabled`).
  - **plugin-detail** — `record:quick_actions` HAD a `disabled` implementation,
    but its `typeof === 'string'` split dropped the `{dialect:'cel', source}`
    envelope the server compiles authored CEL into (#2661 routes envelopes to the
    canonical formula engine), so the predicate never fired on real metadata. It
    now feeds `toPredicateInput`'s result to `useCondition` whole, like every
    other surface.

  Pinned by new `DropdownActionItem` tests (disabled-when-TRUE, false-stays-
  clickable, disabled-wins-over-enabled, boolean literal) and browser-verified
  end-to-end against the showcase `showcase_archive_task` specimen: greyed on an
  in-progress task, clickable on a done one (with `visible` hiding Mark Done on
  the same screen — the hide-vs-grey contrast).

- de5e40c: fix(approvals): Approval Center UX pass — badge nowrap, approve confirm, decision progress bar, localized declared actions (#2762)

  - **Badge no longer stacks CJK text vertically (P0-1)** — `Badge` gains
    `whitespace-nowrap` in its base variants (a badge is a single-line pill by
    definition), and the inbox 状态 column gets a minimum width, so 待审批 can
    never render as 待/审/批.
  - **Quick Approve now confirms (P0-2)** — the row's right-edge ✓, the mobile
    card button and the `a` keyboard shortcut all route through a confirmation
    dialog before executing, mirroring the Reject flow; an irreversible decision
    can no longer fire on a stray click.
  - **Decision progress is visualized (P1-1)** — the drawer renders a segmented
    progress bar (ARIA `progressbar`) for `decision_progress`, per-group chips
    get an explicit unsatisfied ○ state next to the satisfied ✓, the eligible
    approver count is spelled out, and the drawer pager now reads
    "Request N of M" so it can't be misread as approval progress.
  - **Declared action labels localize (P0-3)** — `DeclaredActionsBar` resolves
    label / confirmText / successMessage through the `_actions.<name>.*`
    translation convention (metadata literals as fallback), matching
    ObjectView/RecordDetailView; with the `@objectstack/plugin-approvals`
    bundle, the drawer shows 通过 / 拒绝 / 转签 instead of English in a zh-CN
    workspace. New `approvalsInbox` keys shipped in all ten locales.

- 8fb1295: fix(data-table): keep the right-pinned action column HEADER sticky on horizontal scroll (objectui#2784)

  The row-actions column is pinned to the right edge by injecting `sticky right-0`
  into the column's `className`, which reaches both the body cells and the header
  cell. Body cells stayed pinned, but the header cell unconditionally appended a
  `relative` position utility (it anchors the column-resize handle) — and since
  `cn` is `tailwind-merge`, the later `relative` won over the injected `sticky`.
  So the "操作" title scrolled away while its body cells stayed frozen.

  The header now detects a right-pinned column (its `className` carries
  `sticky` + `right-0`), skips `relative` for it (a sticky cell is already its own
  positioning context, so the `absolute` resize handle still anchors correctly),
  and re-asserts `sticky right-0 z-20` after `col.className` so tailwind-merge
  keeps the pin and it stacks above the body's pinned cells (z-10). Left-frozen
  columns, the resize handle, and non-pinned columns are unaffected.

- c19ac11: fix(form): scroll and focus the first errored field on an invalid submit (#2793)

  Submitting a form with a missing required field already toasts the offending field names (#2329), but in a long form the field itself stays off-screen, so the user still hunts for it. react-hook-form's native focus-on-error only reaches fields whose registered ref is a focusable native input — it silently no-ops for custom widgets (lookup / select / master-detail), which is exactly the reported case. The form renderer now disables RHF's unreliable `shouldFocusError` and, in its `onInvalid` handler, scrolls the first errored field (in visual/declared order) into view via its `data-field` wrapper and focuses a focusable control inside it — working for every field type.

- 2f947e4: fix(page,field): consume the spec's `type`/`label`/`maxLength` keys (framework#1878 §3 naming-drift recheck)

  Three forward-drifts where objectui read a different key than the spec
  declares, so authoring the documented key silently no-oped:

  - **page `type` → `pageType`** (app-shell + components): `PageSchema` declares
    the page KIND as `type`, but `PageRenderer` reads `schema.pageType` and fell
    back to `'record'` — and nothing mapped between them. Every non-record page
    (`home`/`app`/`list`/`utility`) rendered with the record max-width, a wrong
    `data-page-type` attribute, and a suppressed header. `PageView` now passes
    `pageType` alongside the SchemaNode discriminator `type`.
  - **page `label` → `title`** (components): `PageSchema.label` is required but the
    region renderer read only `title`. Now dual-reads `title ?? label`, mirroring
    the fallback `DashboardRenderer` already uses. Coupled with the above — the
    header is gated on `pageType !== 'record'`, so both were needed for a title to
    appear.
  - **field `maxLength`/`minLength`** (plugin-form + fields): validation already
    dual-read these, but `ObjectForm`'s HTML-attribute pass and `TextAreaField`
    read `max_length` only, so a spec-authored `maxLength` gave no browser cap and
    no character counter. Both now dual-read, matching `buildValidationRules`.

  Verified in the browser against the showcase: `capability_map` (`type: 'home'`)
  now renders `data-page-type="home"`, the `home` max-width and its page title;
  record pages are unchanged.

- 7d46648: fix(hooks): stop calling translation hooks inside try/catch (objectui#2879)

  Eleven call sites wrapped a React hook in `try`/`catch` to make it
  "provider-safe". `useObjectTranslation` and `useObjectLabel` already are — they
  read context optionally and fall back to react-i18next's global instance, and
  never throw. The `catch` bought nothing and cost correctness: a throw _after_
  the hook ran desyncs hook order on the next render, because React matches hooks
  positionally. objectui#2595/#2596 fixed exactly this in `@object-ui/i18n`'s
  `createSafeTranslation`; nine plugin-local re-implementations kept their own
  copy of the bug, and two more (`ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectView`) were found by the
  new lint rule below — `ObjectView` had even suppressed
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` inline to keep it.

  - Six exact re-implementations now delegate to `createSafeTranslation`:
    `plugin-detail`, `plugin-timeline`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-calendar`,
    `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid`, `plugin-designer`.
  - `components`' `data-table` also delegates; `createSafeTranslation` now
    returns `language` alongside `t` so consumers that localize dates don't need
    a second hook call. Purely additive.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-grid`'s `ImportWizard` keep their local hooks —
    they fall back _per key_, which a single-probe factory cannot express and
    which their comments justify (a host dictionary that covers common keys but
    lags on newer ones). Only the `try`/`catch` is removed.
  - `ObjectTimeline` and `ObjectView` call the hook directly and probe the
    returned value, mirroring `useSafeFieldLabel`.

  Adds `object-ui/no-try-catch-around-hook` (error) so a twelfth copy fails CI.
  It only matches `use*` names, accepts member calls solely on `React` (so
  `vi.useRealTimers()` is not a hook), and resets its try-depth inside nested
  functions (so `renderHook(() => useThing())` inside a `try` is fine) — both
  false positives were real code in this repo and are pinned in the rule's tests.

  `eslint-rules/**/*.test.js` matched no vitest project glob, so the local
  plugin's specs had never run in CI. They are now included; all three pass.

  `ObjectTimeline`'s test mock of `@object-ui/react` omitted `useObjectLabel` —
  the removed `try`/`catch` had been silently absorbing that gap. The mock is now
  complete.

- 9b53d72: feat(charts): ObjectChart honors the spec `ChartConfig` author shape (objectui#2880 / framework#3729)

  `ChartConfigSchema` is the chart protocol, but the renderer only ever read a
  Recharts-flavoured internal shape — `chartType`, `xAxisKey`, `series[].dataKey`.
  Everything an author wrote in the SPEC shape reached the renderer and was
  silently dropped, which is exactly what ADR-0078 forbids. framework#3725
  documented the gap by trimming the published contract down to the props that
  actually worked; this closes it the other way round.

  **S1 — one normalization boundary.** `normalizeChartSchema` translates the
  author shape into the internal pipeline contract in a single place, rather than
  scattering `??` fallbacks through the render tree (framework PD #12: one
  translation is a contract mapping, N fallbacks are a second dialect):

  - `type` → `chartType`, `xAxis: { field }` → `xAxisKey`, `series: [{ name }]` →
    `series: [{ dataKey }]`
  - the report surface's bare-string `xAxis`/`yAxis` resolve too
  - `yAxis: [{ field }]` alone plots, with no `series` declared
  - **internal props win**, so `DashboardRenderer`, `ObjectView` and the dataset
    path are byte-for-byte unaffected — there is no migration

  **The `type` collision.** `ChartConfig.type` is the chart family, but on any
  surface that flattens chart config into a props bag `type` is already the SDUI
  envelope's component discriminator. Spreading props last let an author's
  `type="bar"` replace `object-chart` so the block stopped resolving; stamping the
  discriminator last ate the author's value instead. The react-page wrapper now
  keeps both: the discriminator wins the `type` slot and the author's value is
  preserved beside it as `specType`, which the normalizer reads back.

  **S2 — axis presentation.** `ChartAxis.format` drives the tick formatter (via
  `Intl.NumberFormat`, no new dependency), `min`/`max` pin the domain,
  `logarithmic` swaps the scale, `title` labels the axis, and `showGridLines` is
  honored. A second `yAxis` entry (or `position: 'right'`) turns on the secondary
  axis that `series[].yAxis` binds to — in combo charts an explicit binding now
  beats the family-derived bar→left/line→right guess. `showLegend` is honored,
  and `title`/`subtitle` render above the plot instead of only titling the
  drill-down drawer.

  **S3 — `series[].stack`, `annotations`, `interaction`.** Stacking passes the
  author's group name through as Recharts' `stackId`. Annotations render as
  `ReferenceLine` (`type: 'line'`) / `ReferenceArea` (`type: 'region'`) with the
  declared axis, colour, style and label. `interaction.tooltips: false` suppresses
  the hover card and `interaction.brush: true` adds the range selector;
  `showDataLabels` prints values on the marks. `interaction.zoom` has no Recharts
  primitive behind it and is deliberately still unimplemented rather than faked.

- 53642d4: fix(core,fields): a string `$orderby` is a clause, not a character array — and localize the sharing-rule widgets (objectstack#3821)

  **The recipient picker listed nothing, ever.** `QueryParams['$orderby']` was
  typed as `Record | string[] | SortObject[]`, so `queryParamsToRecord` sent any
  non-array value through `Object.entries`. Handed the clause string `'name asc'`
  — which callers do build by hand — it walked the string index by index and
  emitted `$orderby=0 n,1 a,2 m,3 e,4 ,5 a,6 s,7 c`. The server sorted by columns
  that don't exist and every row was filtered out, so
  `sys_sharing_rule.recipient_id` rendered "No matches" for every recipient type
  and no sharing rule could be created from the Console. `ObjectGrid` builds the
  same shape from a schema-level `sort` in three places, so grids with a string
  sort silently showed an empty table.

  A string `$orderby` is now passed through verbatim (the server's OData
  normalizer has always parsed `'name asc'`), and the type admits `string`.
  `RecipientPickerField` additionally switched to the structured
  `{ name: 'asc' }` form so it can't regress this way against any data source.

  **The three sharing-rule authoring widgets never had translations.**
  `ObjectRefField`, `RecipientPickerField` and `FilterConditionField` hardcoded
  their English copy — a Chinese Console showed "Select an object", "Select a
  user", "Search…", "No matches", "Edit as JSON". They now go through
  `useFieldTranslation` like every other widget, with keys added under `fields.*`
  in all ten locales.

  The recipient placeholder was the interesting one: it read
  `` `Select a ${recipientType.replace(/_/g,' ')}` ``, interpolating the enum
  value into an English sentence — a shape no locale can translate. It is now a
  per-type key (`fields.recipient.selectUser`, `…selectBusinessUnit`, …), so
  "选择业务单元" and "Select a business unit" no longer have to share a structure.

  **Editing a rule silently dropped its recipient.** The picker resets the stored
  id when `recipient_type` changes, because an id valid for a user is meaningless
  for a team. It treated the edit form's `'' → 'user'` hydration as such a change:
  opening any saved rule blanked the recipient, and saving persisted the blank.
  Only a non-empty predecessor now counts as a type switch.

  **Building a filter submitted the surrounding form.** None of `FilterBuilder`'s
  controls declared `type="button"`, and a bare `<button>` inside a `<form>`
  defaults to `type="submit"`. Adding, removing or clearing a condition therefore
  submitted the sharing-rule dialog — firing validation mid-edit, and on an
  already-valid form saving the record before the admin was done.

  **A rejected write showed the user raw server diagnostics.** The form rendered
  `error.message` verbatim, so a sharing / RLS denial reached the dialog and the
  toast as `FORBIDDEN: insufficient privileges to update showcase_private_note
pi-TgoJ4_DM55Fqz` — untranslated, and leaking the object's machine name and the
  record id to whoever hit it. Permission failures now render localized copy
  (`form.noPermissionToSave`, added in all ten locales), with the server text kept
  on the console for debugging; other failures still show the server's message,
  which is the useful part, and fall back to `form.submitFailed` when there is
  none — replacing the previously hardcoded English "An error occurred during
  submission".

  **The detail header offered "Edit" on records the user may only read.** Object
  permissions can't express "this one record is read-only" — a read-only sharing
  grant sits inside an object the user may otherwise edit — so the header showed
  the primary Edit CTA, opened the form, and let the user retype a field before
  the server rejected the save. `DetailView` now gates Edit / Delete on the
  object-level check AND on the explain engine's record-grained verdict
  (`POST /api/v1/security/explain` with a `recordId`, ADR-0090 D6 / ADR-0095 C2 —
  the same pipeline the enforcement middleware runs, so button and server cannot
  disagree). Explaining oneself needs no special permission. The probe is one
  cached request per record, skipped entirely when the object-level check already
  says no, and **fails open** on every uncertainty — an unanswered hint must never
  be the reason a permitted user cannot act; the server stays the authority
  (ADR-0057 D10).

  **A long option rendered straight past the combobox border.** `Combobox`'s
  trigger pinned itself to the component's `w-[200px]` default while the fields
  around it ran the full form column, and the selected label was a bare text child
  of a flex button — flex items need `truncate` AND `min-w-0` to clip, and it had
  neither. So "成员 (showcase_project_membership)" in the object picker overflowed
  the control and collided with the field beside it. The label now truncates, the
  trigger can shrink, the dropdown matches the trigger's width instead of a
  hardcoded 200px (a widened combobox used to clip its own options), and the two
  sharing-rule pickers ask for `w-full` so they line up with every other input.

  Hardens `evaluatePermission` while there: a role config carrying only
  `fieldPermissions` (no `actions`) made `check()` throw a TypeError that
  propagated out of the render. A permission check must not be able to crash a
  view.

  Browser-verified against the framework showcase Console in Chinese: object /
  criteria / recipient copy is fully localized, the recipient dropdown lists real
  users, business units and positions, a saved rule reopens with its recipient and
  criteria intact, editing the filter no longer submits, and a rule created
  end-to-end stores a real record id rather than free text. The criteria authored
  in the builder is honored by the evaluator: `{"pinned":true}` on an owner-private
  object granted the recipient exactly the matching records and nothing else.

- c6aaed8: fix(i18n): retire four hand-rolled zh/en branches (objectui#2871, part 1)

  Four surfaces decided their language with a hand-written `startsWith('zh')`
  check instead of the locale packs, so the other eight shipped languages
  silently rendered English and the strings could never be translated without a
  code change.

  - **`RecordTitleChip`** carried a private zh-CN/zh-TW dictionary behind a
    comment claiming "components is i18n-free". That is not true —
    `@object-ui/components` declares `@object-ui/i18n` and its sibling
    `containers.tsx` already uses it. All four of its keys (`detail.copied`,
    `detail.copyRecordId`, `detail.addToFavorites`, `detail.removeFromFavorites`)
    already existed in **all ten packs**, so this deletes ~35 lines and fixes ten
    locales with zero new translations. It renders on every record detail page.
  - **`EnvironmentListToolbar`**'s three state-aware CTA labels move to a new
    `environment.*` namespace. This surface had already regressed once for the
    same reason (#844) and was fixed then with inline `{en,zh}` pairs.
  - **`StudioAiCopilot`**'s dock title moves to the Studio catalog as
    `engine.studio.aiCopilot`.
  - **`StudioHomePage.relativeTime`** now uses `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` with
    `numeric: 'auto'` instead of five `zh ? … : …` ternaries. This is strictly
    better than adding ten catalog keys: it covers every locale, applies the
    correct plural rules, and yields "yesterday" / 「昨天」 rather than "1d ago".
    Arabic gets its dual form («أسبوعين») — something a ternary cannot express.

  The new `environment.*` keys are added to all ten packs, so this does not widen
  the gap tracked by objectui#2872 part (a).

  `EnvironmentListToolbar`'s tests now render inside a real `I18nProvider` pinned
  to `en`. Without one, `t()` returns the raw key, so the previous assertions on
  literal English would have been asserting nothing.

- dc334da: fix(i18n): close the last three zh-branch gaps (objectui#2871, part 3)

  The three items the #2871 classification marked as real but _not_ a
  migrate-the-copy fix. Each needed a different remedy.

  **`LoadingScreen` — ten languages collapsed to two.** The boot splash already
  selected real locale packs (not inline copy), but through
  `lang.startsWith('zh') ? zh : en`, so a ja/ko/de user watched the whole startup
  in English. It now indexes `builtInLocales` by the two-letter prefix.

  Each field falls back to `en` **individually**, which matters: `console.*` is
  one of the namespaces that trails in the non-`zh` packs (objectui#2872 part a),
  so a whole-object swap would have rendered `undefined` on the splash rather
  than English. `console.loadingHint` was in fact missing from all eight — added
  here, since a blank line under the progress list is worse than an English one.

  **`containers.tsx` — two language sources that could disagree.** The tab-label
  call sites resolved `language` from `useObjectTranslation()`, then handed the
  string to `translateLabel`, which called `detectLocale()` and read
  `document.documentElement.lang` on its own. Those update independently, so an
  in-app language switch could leave a tab label and its surrounding chrome in
  different languages until the next reload. `language` is now threaded in, and
  `detectLocale` is deleted so nothing reaches for the DOM again.

  **`field-types.ts` — a two-language data catalog.** `FieldTypeMeta` carried a
  `labelZh` column beside `label`, which capped the field-type picker at English
  or Chinese by construction. The 46 type names and 9 category names move into
  the Studio catalog as `engine.fieldType.<id>` / `engine.fieldCategory.<cat>`,
  generated from the existing values so no wording changes. This removes the
  `isZh` helper from **both** `ObjectFieldInspector` and `ObjectFormCanvas` — the
  two files the classification listed as "keep the component, fix the catalog".

  The picker's search filter previously matched `id`, the English label, and
  `labelZh` — so searching in Japanese or German matched nothing. It now matches
  the label as the user actually sees it.

### Patch Changes

- ef14f69: feat(fields): CheckboxesField per-option `visibleWhen` cascading + `dependsOn` gating (completes the option-widget parity set)

  `checkboxes` was the last static-option widget still rendering `config.options`
  raw — with no per-option `visibleWhen` filtering, `dependsOn` gating, or cascade
  clear. It now matches `MultiSelectField` (its multi-value sibling), completing
  the ADR-0058 parity across `select` / `multiselect` / `radio` / `checkboxes`.

  - **`@object-ui/fields`**: `CheckboxesField` routes through the shared
    `useCascadingOptions` hook — offered boxes narrow against the live record +
    `current_user`, the control gates behind a "select the parent first" hint
    while a `dependsOn` field is empty, and selections no longer offered are
    pruned per-element from the array. Adds `checkboxes-empty-*` /
    `checkboxes-option-*` testids.
  - **`@object-ui/components`**: adds `checkboxes` to the form renderer's option
    field sets (`CASCADE_OPTION_FIELD_TYPES`, the cross-field cascade-clear
    effect, and the option pre-filter) so a `checkboxes` field is threaded
    `dependentValues` and gated identically to the other option widgets.
  - Tests: `CheckboxesField.cascade.test.tsx` mirrors `MultiSelectField.cascade.test.tsx`.

- 69fa5d1: chore(lint): clear the baseline lint errors in components (objectui#2713 Wave 3)

  Wave 3 of the #2713 lint-gate restoration. `@object-ui/components` was red at
  baseline on `main`; cleared every **error** (no behavior change; warnings out of
  scope):

  - **`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`** — `react-page` `ReactKindPage` had a
    capability-gate early return _before_ four hooks (incl. a `useEffect` that
    `import()`s the react runtime). Hoisted the hooks above the gate **and guarded
    the import** (`if (!capabilityEnabled) return` inside the effect) so a disabled
    build still never loads the gated runtime; the disabled notice is returned
    after the hooks. Translation helpers in `empty` / `action-bar` / `action-menu`
    unwrap a try/catch around the provider-safe `useObjectTranslation` (the #2709
    fix).
  - **`react-hooks/static-components`** — dynamic renderer/icon lookups
    (`ComponentRegistry.get`, `resolveIcon`) in `action-bar` / `action-group` ×2 /
    `action-menu`, and the five `__tests__` helpers that render a registry-resolved
    component, are stable references → justified scoped disables.
  - **`react-hooks/purity`** — `ui/sidebar` skeleton width uses `Math.random()`
    once per mount (`useMemo([])`) for a decorative placeholder → justified scoped
    disable.
  - **`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`** — `ShimmerSkeletonProps` empty
    extend → `type` alias.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** — `test-utils` `maxDepth` dead initializer → single
    `const`.
  - **`no-require-imports`** — `config-panel-renderer` test uses a top-level
    `import React` instead of an in-test `require`.
  - **stale `eslint-disable`** — removed a `jsx-a11y/alt-text` directive in
    `elements` whose plugin is not loaded in the flat config.

- 1629313: feat(fields): RadioField per-option `visibleWhen` cascading + `dependsOn` gating; single-source the option resolver

  Brings `RadioField` to parity with `SelectField` / `MultiSelectField` for ADR-0058
  cascading & role-gated options, and collapses the three copies of the
  gate-then-filter logic onto one shared resolver.

  - **`@object-ui/core`**: new pure `resolveCascadingOptions(rawOptions, record, dependsOn, scope)`
    → `{ options, gated, dependsOnFields }` — the single source of truth for
    `dependsOn` gating + per-option `visibleWhen` filtering.
  - **`@object-ui/fields`**: `RadioField` now narrows its offered radios against
    the live record + `current_user`, gates behind a "select the parent first"
    hint while a `dependsOn` field is empty, and clears a value no longer offered
    (scalar cascade clear). The `useCascadingOptions` hook is refactored to a thin
    React wrapper over `resolveCascadingOptions`.
  - **`@object-ui/components`**: the form renderer's inline option pre-filter and
    cross-field cascade-clear effect now call `resolveCascadingOptions` instead of
    re-deriving gating/filtering, so they can't drift from the widgets (no
    behavior change).
  - Tests: `RadioField.cascade.test.tsx` mirrors the select cascade tests; core
    gains `resolveCascadingOptions` unit coverage.

### Minor Changes

- 5534535: feat(grid): built-in row Edit/Delete honor per-record CEL predicates (#2614)

  The object's `userActions.edit` / `userActions.delete` now also accept an
  object form `{ enabled?, visibleWhen?, disabledWhen? }`. The predicates are
  evaluated per row on the canonical CEL engine (`useRowPredicate`, the same
  machinery custom row actions use): `visibleWhen` false → the built-in
  Edit/Delete item is not rendered for that row (fail-closed); `disabledWhen`
  true → rendered disabled (fail-soft). Wired through ObjectGrid's
  RowActionMenu and the data-table's row overflow menu (the related-list
  path), with the app-shell `crudAffordances` mirror kept in lockstep.
  Omitting the predicates (or using plain booleans) keeps today's behavior
  bit-for-bit; declared predicates evaluate only when a row's menu opens, so
  grid rendering cost is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 4c7c47f: fix(form): thread live `dependentValues` to cascading option fields (#2284/#1583)

  The form renderer only injected the live form record into data-source widgets
  (`lookup`/`master_detail`/… — the `DATA_SOURCE_FIELD_TYPES` set). Registered
  option widgets (`field:select`/`field:radio`/`field:multiselect`) that carry
  per-option `visibleWhen` + `dependsOn` cascading were **excluded**, so
  `stripRegisteredFieldProps` dropped `dependentValues` before it reached
  `SelectField`. With no live record and no `formValues` context fallback, a
  cascading `select` never saw its controlling field: in a create form the
  dependent field stayed permanently gated on the "Select the parent first" hint
  even after the parent was chosen (reproduced on the showcase `showcase_cascade`
  B3 fixture — country → province never unlocked).

  Option field types now receive `dependentValues` too, so the widget's
  `dependsOn` gate lifts and its `visibleWhen` set re-filters live as the parent
  changes — the same channel the lookup fix (#2215/#2216) already used. Regression
  guard added in `form-dependent-values.test.tsx` (drives the registered
  `field:select` path, not just the builtin `case 'select'` fallback the prior
  cascading-select test covered).

- 33b4995: Welcome-page "Create your environment" deep-links straight into the create
  dialog (#844): `action:button` gains a client-side `autoTrigger` flag (runs
  the action once on mount — same execute path as a click, so param dialogs /
  confirms / entitlement gates still apply), and the environments list consumes
  `?runAction=create_environment` to mark its create action once entitlements
  resolve (upgrade-locked orgs get the upgrade prompt instead; the param is
  stripped after consumption so refresh/back don't re-open). Also localizes the
  EnvironmentListToolbar's state-aware label overrides ({en,zh}) — they were
  hard-coded English inside a zh console.

### Minor Changes

- dea65f7: Unify the list-view conditional tier onto the canonical CEL engine (#1584).

  Conditional formatting (list / grid / kanban) and row-action `visible` /
  `disabled` predicates are now evaluated by `@objectstack/formula`'s
  `ExpressionEngine` — the same engine the server uses — instead of the legacy
  JS-dialect `ExpressionEvaluator`, matching how `@objectstack/spec` already types
  these surfaces (`ExpressionInputSchema` / CEL). The whole platform now speaks one
  expression dialect (framework ADR-0058).

  - `@object-ui/core`: new `evalRowPredicate` + `resolveConditionalFormatting`
    helpers (next to `evalFieldPredicate`). One implementation of all three
    formatting rule shapes; dialect routing (a `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope is
    always CEL; a bare string is CEL unless it carries legacy-only syntax
    (`${…}` / `===` / `?.` / `.includes()`), which routes to the old engine with a
    one-time deprecation warning); the native `{ field, operator, value }` form is
    translated to CEL.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `useRowPredicate` hook (canonical CEL, ambient
    predicate scope merged).
  - Consumers converged: `ListView.evaluateConditionalFormatting` (thin wrapper,
    export kept), `ObjectGrid` row styling (inline copy removed), kanban card
    styles, and the grid / data-table row-action menus. `plugin-view`'s kanban
    branch now forwards top-level `conditionalFormatting` (previously dropped).
  - Row-action `visible` fails **closed** (broken predicate → hidden + warn);
    `disabled` fails soft. The CEL `in` operator (and list membership) now work in
    row predicates — the legacy engine could not parse them.
  - The legacy `FormField.condition: { field, equals/notEquals/in }` is retired to
    a CEL translation (back-compat preserved); `FieldDesigner` migrated to
    `visibleWhen`.

  Fully back-compat: existing conditional-formatting rules, row-action predicates,
  and form `condition` metadata keep working (translated / routed as needed).

- 073e7aa: Conditional tabs (framework#2606): the `page:tabs` renderer honors an item-level
  `visibleWhen` CEL predicate — when it evaluates FALSE the WHOLE tab (header +
  panel) is omitted from the strip, unlike a child component's own `visibleWhen`,
  which hides only the panel content and leaves an empty tab header behind. The
  predicate binds the same environment as page-component `visibleWhen` (record
  fields bare and via `record.`/`data.`, `user`/`current_user`, and page state as
  `page.<var>`) and re-evaluates live as page variables change. The strip is now
  controlled: when the ACTIVE tab's predicate flips false, selection falls back to
  the first visible tab instead of leaving a blank panel, and the user's own
  selection is restored if the tab becomes visible again. Canonical ADR-0089 key
  only — the deprecated `visibility`/`visibleOn` aliases are not read on this new
  surface. Items without `visibleWhen` behave exactly as before.
- 6c0135c: feat(page-header): metadata-driven multi-button record header (#2361)

  The record detail page header no longer hardcodes a single inline primary
  button (`INLINE_MAX = 1`). It now renders up to `maxVisible` actions
  side-by-side (default 3 desktop / 1 mobile, overridable via
  `maxVisible` / `mobileMaxVisible` on the `page:header` schema) — the same
  contract as `action:bar` — so multi-action objects (e.g. Lead: Convert /
  Assign / Return) can surface several primary buttons at once.

  Which actions claim the inline slots is declared in metadata, mirroring the
  `action:bar` #2339 rules:

  - `order` ascending (unset = 0; lower = more prominent), stable sort;
  - `variant: 'primary'` as a tie-break within equal order (also mapped to the
    Shadcn `default` Button variant instead of leaking through);
  - `component: 'action:menu'` pins an action inside the `⋯` overflow menu
    regardless of the action count.

  The synthesized system actions declare their placement accordingly:
  `sys_edit` gets `order: 100` (behind every authored business action, but
  still inline when slots remain), while `sys_share` / `sys_delete` are pinned
  into the `⋯` menu via `component: 'action:menu'` — Delete never surfaces as
  an inline red button just because an object has few actions.

### Patch Changes

- 055e1d2: fix(components): exit inline edit mode for injected cell editors (#2321)

  Non-discrete inline-edit cells (text, number, date, lookup, user, currency,
  percent, …) got permanently stuck in edit mode: the host-injected `@object-ui/fields`
  widget staged its value on every change but had no way to leave edit mode, so
  clicking outside, pressing Enter, and the row Save button all failed to dismiss
  the editor. Only discrete pickers (select/boolean/radio/rating), which commit on
  selection, exited correctly.

  The DataTable now gives injected widget editors the same exit affordances the
  built-in `<input>` editors have:

  - **Click-outside** commits the staged value and exits, via a capture-phase
    document `pointerdown` listener. It is portal-aware — clicking inside a lookup
    popover / record-picker dialog the widget itself opened does not exit, and a
    modal that merely hosts the grid does not suppress the commit.
  - **Enter** commits and exits (a multi-line `textarea` keeps inserting newlines).
  - **Escape** reverts this session's staged changes and exits.

  Keys that bubble up through a React portal from the widget's own popover keep
  driving that popover rather than the cell. Built-in editors are untouched.

- f30ff68: fix(components): keep the list-view horizontal scrollbar pinned to the viewport bottom

  In a list/grid view with many columns, the horizontal scrollbar was only
  reachable after scrolling all the way to the last row. Root cause: the shadcn
  `<Table>` wraps its `<table>` in a `overflow-auto` scroll `<div>`. When
  `DataTable` already renders the table inside a _bounded_
  `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-auto` region, that default wrapper became a SECOND,
  height-unbounded scroll container — it stretched to the full table height, so
  its horizontal scrollbar sat at the bottom of _all_ rows.

  - `Table` gains an optional `containerClassName` prop that overrides the
    scroll-wrapper `<div>`'s classes (default behavior unchanged).
  - `DataTable` passes `containerClassName="overflow-visible"` so the outer
    bounded container owns both axes and the horizontal scrollbar stays pinned to
    the viewport bottom — reachable from any scroll position, no need to scroll to
    the last row.

  Verified end-to-end against the running console (data-table with 60+ rows × 19
  columns): the horizontal scroller is now the bounded `flex-1 min-h-0
overflow-auto` region (bottom on-screen, within the viewport) and the table can
  be scrolled fully right while still at the top row.

- 4afb251: Record-level inline edit polish (objectui#2572, follow-up to #2407) — the five
  rough edges from the live showcase verification pass:

  - **Expanded reference values pass through to the picker.** `InlineFieldInput`
    no longer collapses an `$expand`-ed record object to a bare id before
    handing it to `LookupField` / `UserField` — the picker resolves the display
    name it already carries instead of re-fetching the referenced record via
    `findOne` (or sticking on the placeholder when it can't). `LookupField`
    still hands its Level-2 pickers (PeoplePicker / RecordPickerDialog) bare
    ids, collapsed via the existing `normalizeId`.
  - **Approval-lock preflight.** The record page now re-reads the approval
    state whenever the record is invalidated (a save can _trigger_ an approval
    flow that locks the record), derives one `approvalLocked` signal
    (`approval_status` pending/in_approval OR an open pending request), gates
    the inline-edit session's `canEdit` with it — hiding the pencil affordances
    and no-op'ing `enter()` on a locked record — and drives the save bar's
    `locked`/`lockedHint` so users can't type into a draft that Save would
    reject with `RECORD_LOCKED`.
  - **Numeric field types edit with the real numeric widgets.** `number` /
    `currency` / `percent` route to `NumberField` / `CurrencyField` /
    `PercentField` (the same widgets the form uses) instead of a free-text
    input: numeric keyboard, symbol adornment, fraction↔percent display
    conversion, and numbers (not strings) into the draft. `NumberField` and
    `CurrencyField` now surface metadata `min`/`max` on the input, `NumberField`
    honors an explicit `step` and steps by 1 for `scale: 0` (previously fell
    back to `any`).
  - **Header Edit CTA stands down during an inline session.** The synthesized
    `sys_edit` action carries `disableDuringInlineEdit`, and the `page:header`
    renderer greys such actions out while `InlineEditContext.editing` — the
    classic form-edit surface can no longer be stacked on top of a live inline
    draft.
  - **Keyboard shortcuts for the shared edit session.** `InlineEditSaveBar`
    binds **Esc → cancel** (deferring to any open Radix layer — popover /
    select / dialog — which owns Escape for "close") and **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter →
    save**, both respecting `saving`/`locked`.

## 14.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a74160: Sharing-rule form: pick, don't type. Three new widget-hint field components make
  the generic object form render pickers where an admin previously had to type
  machine data (driven by the framework `widget` hints on `sys_sharing_rule`;
  generalizes the `capability-multiselect` pattern). All degrade to the underlying
  `type` renderer when a widget is unregistered.

  - **`object-ref`** — choose a registered object by name (searchable `Combobox`),
    backed by the new `DataSource.getObjects()` (`ObjectStackAdapter` lists code-
    and DB-defined objects via `/api/v1/meta/object`), falling back to a
    `sys_metadata` query. Stores the object's `name`.
  - **`filter-condition`** — a visual criteria builder (`FilterBuilder`) scoped to
    the fields of the object chosen in a sibling field (via `getObjectSchema`),
    round-tripping the stored **MongoDB-style** FilterCondition JSON. Criteria the
    builder can't represent (or invalid JSON) fall back to a raw-JSON editor, with
    an always-available "Edit as JSON" toggle — nothing is hidden or lost.
  - **`recipient-picker`** — a record picker whose target object follows a sibling
    `recipient_type` (`user`→sys_user, `team`→sys_team, `business_unit`/
    `unit_and_subordinates`→sys_business_unit, `position`→sys_position), storing the
    value the evaluator matches on (a record id, or the position **name**). Resets
    the stored id when the type changes.

  Wiring: the three keys join `DATA_SOURCE_FIELD_TYPES` (form.tsx) so the form
  threads `dataSource` + `dependentValues` to them, and `INLINE_EXCLUDED_FIELD_TYPES`
  (they're authored in the record form, not a grid cell). `DataSource.getObjects()`
  is optional on the interface; the ObjectStack adapter implements it.

### Patch Changes

- a44e7b6: Form fields honor their object-schema `widget` render hint on the field-group /
  section layout path. `ObjectForm` renders objects that declare field groups
  (e.g. `sys_sharing_rule`) via an auto-derived section layout that passed each
  field's metadata through without hoisting its `widget` override to the top-level
  form-field config, so a field with `widget: 'object-ref'` (or `filter-condition`
  / `recipient-picker`) degraded to its bare `type` input — an admin was asked to
  hand-type an object name instead of picking it. The form renderer now falls back
  to the field metadata's own `widget` when no top-level override is present, so
  the pickers render on sectioned forms just as they do on flat ones.

## 13.2.0

### Patch Changes

- 80901aa: Honor action `visible` (and `enabled`) predicates in three more action renderers.

  Following the data-table row-action fix, three sibling renderers still rendered schema-defined actions without evaluating their `visible` CEL predicate:

  - **`action:group` dropdown mode** (`@object-ui/components`) — dropdown items ignored `visible`/`enabled`, while the group's inline mode already honored them.
  - **Related-list `list_toolbar` header actions** (`@object-ui/plugin-detail`) — e.g. an organization's "Invite User" button ignored `visible`, even though the sibling row actions (fed by the same `deriveActions` bridge) already honored it via the data-table's `DataTableRowActionItem`.
  - **Grid bulk-action bar** (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`) — `bulkActionDefs.visible` was ignored entirely; the button is now hidden when the predicate is false (the `BulkActionDef.visible` doc comment is corrected from "disables" to "hides" to match).

  Each now evaluates `visible` (and, where applicable, `enabled`) via a hook-safe per-item component that mirrors `RowActionMenuItem` / `DataTableRowActionItem`, resolving `features`/`user` from the ambient `ExpressionProvider` scope. Rendering-layer only — no action definitions changed.

- e492b9d: Permission sets — pure separation of **design** (Studio) and **assignment**
  (Setup), per ADR-0056 / epic #2398. A `sys_permission_set` used to render its six
  authorization facets in Setup as raw `[Object]` / JSON textareas, and only
  objects+fields were editable in Studio; this reworks both surfaces.

  **Setup (assign + read-only):**

  - The six facets (`object_permissions`, `field_permissions`, `system_permissions`,
    `row_level_security`, `tab_permissions`, `admin_scope`) now render read-only on
    the `sys_permission_set` record page as a compact summary (counts, or capability
    chips) plus a **“Design in Studio →”** deep-link into the structured editor
    (`/apps/:appName/metadata/permission/:setName`, env scope). No `[Object]`, no
    JSON — in the record view, inline edit, and the create/edit form. Implemented as
    a `permission-facet-link` field widget stamped onto the six fields via the single
    `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` choke point and honored by DetailSection +
    the record form.
  - User assignment (add/remove via `sys_user_permission_set`) is surfaced directly
    on the Setup record page.

  **Studio (design every facet):** the permission matrix editor gains structured
  editors for the facets that were JSON-only —

  - **System Capabilities**: a multi-select over the live `sys_capability` registry
    (scope-grouped, labelled chips).
  - **Row-Level Security**: per-policy rows (object · operation · enabled) with CEL
    USING/CHECK.
  - **Tab Visibility**: per-tab `visible | hidden | default_on | default_off`.
  - **Delegated Admin Scope**: business-unit + subtree, manage-assignments /
    -bindings / author-env-sets toggles, and an assignable-permission-sets allowlist.
    Assignment was moved out of the editor (it is now a Setup act) — the editor is
    purely a design surface.

  Storage/types are unchanged; editors read/write the draft’s existing parsed
  fields and tolerate legacy JSON strings on load. Note: env-scope metadata saves of
  these facets do not yet project onto the queryable `sys_permission_set` data
  record the Setup summary reads, so a fresh Studio edit isn’t reflected in Setup’s
  read-only view until the projection refreshes — tracked as a framework follow-up
  (enforcement reads the authoritative metadata).

## 13.0.0

### Patch Changes

- ac04b76: Data-table row menu: honor each custom row action's `visible` (and `disabled`) predicate.

  The data-table's inline row overflow menu — used by a record detail page's related list — rendered every custom row action unconditionally, ignoring the action's `visible` CEL. ObjectGrid's row menu already evaluates `visible` per row (`RowActionMenuItem`), so the two row-menu paths disagreed: on an organization's Members tab, `sys_member`'s `transfer_ownership` action (`visible: "record.role != 'owner' && …"`) showed on the owner's own row.

  Each custom action now renders through a hook-safe `DataTableRowActionItem` that mirrors `RowActionMenuItem`, evaluating `visible`/`disabled` with `useCondition`/`toPredicateInput` against the same per-row context (`{ ...row, record: row }`); `features`/`user` resolve from the ambient `ExpressionProvider` scope, so gating matches the grid. Rendering-layer only — the action definitions are unchanged.

- 619097e: Adopt `@objectstack/spec` 13 (ADR-0090 Permission Model v2) across the workspace.

  Every workspace package now depends on `@objectstack/spec` ^13.0.0 — the v2 major that renames role → position (D3), removes the profile concept (D2), makes OWD default to `private` when unset (D1), and drops the legacy `read`/`read_write`/`full` sharing aliases (D4). UI fallout fixed in the same sweep:

  - **clientValidation**: the `role` draft-schema loader is now `position` → `PositionSchema` (fixes the `RoleSchema does not exist` build break, #2365); the dead `profile` loader is removed (D2).
  - **Studio previews**: `RolePreview` → `PositionPreview` (flat — positions carry no hierarchy; the old parent-chain breadcrumb and "assign to a Profile" copy are gone). Legacy `role`/`profile` preview keys stay registered for pre-v2 backends.
  - **OWD control** (`ObjectSettingsPanel`): removed the now-dead alias normalization (spec 13 rejects the aliases at authoring time) and the amber "fully public" warning — an unset sharing model now defaults to Private (D1), and the copy says so in both locales.
  - **Fallback schemas / anchors / samples**: `position` replaces the hierarchical `role` fallback schema; `isProfile` dropped from the permission create-anchor and previews samples; permission-set viewer no longer renders a profile badge; console System hub counts `sys_position` instead of the removed `sys_role`.
  - **Studio i18n**: type labels `Role/角色` → `Position/岗位`, `profile` label removed, Access-pillar heading and sharing copy rewritten to the v2 vocabulary.
  - `@object-ui/types` now exports `SubmitBehavior` (was defined but missing from the public surface, breaking `@object-ui/plugin-form`'s re-export under a clean build).
  - **External OWD dial (D11)**: the object Settings sharing card gains an `externalSharingModel` select (portal/partner baseline) with an inline wider-than-internal warning mirroring the publish-time lint.
  - **Permission matrix OWD badges**: every object row now shows its record-level baseline (`OWD Public read`, `Ext Private`, or `OWD Private (default)` for the D1 fail-closed unset case) so grant edits carry their record-reach context.

  The flow designer's approval assignee `role` kind is intentionally unchanged — spec 13 keeps it as the sole D3 exception (better-auth `sys_member.role` org-membership tier).

## 12.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c31874d: Record-header actions honour `Action.order`, so approval decisions no longer get buried in the `⋯` overflow menu (objectui#2339 / framework#2670).

  The `action:bar` renderer now stable-sorts its actions by an explicit **`order`** field (lower = higher / more prominent, default `0`) before the inline/overflow split. The sort is stable and treats unset `order` as `0`, so action groups where nobody sets `order` keep their exact registration order — existing toolbars are unaffected. `order` is added to `ActionSchema` in `@object-ui/types`, mirroring `Action.order` in `@objectstack/spec`.

  `RecordDetailView` now assigns the injected **Approve / Reject** decision buttons a strongly-negative `order` (and gives Approve the highlighted `primary` variant), so on a pending-approval record the approver's decision takes the primary-button slot and app `record_header` actions follow it — instead of the app having to hide its own actions to surface the decision.

### Patch Changes

- 6cbccf3: Localize form validation messages, toast client-side validation failures, and make native date/time picker icons legible in dark mode.

  Record-form validation messages (required, min/max length, min/max value, pattern, email, URL) were hard-coded English even when the field label was localized — e.g. a Chinese "计划开始日期" field showed "计划开始日期 is required". `buildValidationRules` baked English strings, so the form renderer's `t(...)` fallback never applied. It now emits `required: true` and, for the other rules, a `messageKey` + `undefined` message (a field-authored `*_message` still wins and passes through verbatim); the form renderer fills the blanks via i18n (`validation.*` keys already exist in every locale), so messages track the label's language.

  When client-side validation blocks a submit, the offending field's inline error can sit below the fold in a long modal/drawer form — the user clicks 创建 and sees nothing happen. The form renderer now also fires a `toast.error` naming the fields (`validation.formInvalid`, added to all 10 locales), mirroring the existing server-error toast so the feedback is visible regardless of scroll position.

  Separately, native controls now declare `color-scheme` (`light` on `:root`, `dark` on `.dark`), so the webkit calendar-picker-indicator and other built-in glyphs render light-on-dark instead of vanishing against the dark input background.

## 12.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 226fde9: Cascading & role-gated `select` options (#2284).

  `select` options now accept a per-option `visibleWhen` CEL predicate — the option
  is offered only when it evaluates TRUE against the live record **plus
  `current_user`** (same engine/env as a field-level `visibleWhen`). Combined with a
  field-level `dependsOn`, this drives dependent selects (country → province → city)
  and role/context gating with no bespoke matrix — the same primitives dependent
  lookups (#2215) already use.

  - `@object-ui/core` exposes `resolveVisibleOptions` / `isOptionGroupGated` /
    `resolveDependsOnFields` / `isValueStillOffered` (evaluator), reusing the
    canonical `evalFieldPredicate`.
  - The form renderer narrows a dependent select's option list, gates the control
    with a "Select {parent} first" hint while a `dependsOn` field is empty, and
    clears a now-invalid value when the parent changes.
  - The standalone `SelectField` widget applies the same resolution via
    `dependentValues` + the global predicate scope.

  Client-side hiding is UX, not authorization: gate authorization-sensitive option
  values on the server too. Aligns with `@objectstack/spec` `SelectOption.visibleWhen`.

- e4de456: Fix form section grouping inconsistencies found in a UX review of grouped forms:

  - **Unified section visual language.** `FormSection`'s Card-wrapped path (used by Modal/Split/Tabbed/Wizard forms) previously rendered as a nearly-invisible white-on-white card (same `bg-card` as the page background, distinguished only by a barely-visible shadow) with a duplicated, inconsistent header (different title size, and a collapse chevron positioned differently) versus the flat `SectionDivider` path used by simple/drawer forms. Both now share the same header treatment (`text-sm font-semibold`, inline-left chevron, bottom border), and the Card path gets a soft `bg-muted/40` tint so grouped sections are visually distinguishable without relying on shadow alone.
  - **`readonly` no longer renders as `disabled`.** A field marked `readonly` (statically or via `readonlyWhen`) was being folded into the `disabled` prop before reaching field widgets, so widgets with a dedicated readonly display (e.g. `EmailField`'s mailto link, `TextField`'s plain-text view) never received it — every readonly field just looked permanently disabled. `readonly` is now forwarded as its own prop; generic `input`/`textarea` fields get a distinct readonly style (`bg-muted/40`, no `cursor-not-allowed`) instead of the disabled look.
  - **Section `className`/`gridClassName` now flow through JSON schemas.** `ObjectFormSection` and the per-form-variant section configs (`ModalFormSectionConfig`, `SplitFormSectionConfig`, `FormSectionConfig`, `DrawerFormSectionConfig`) accept `className` (and `gridClassName` where applicable), wired through `ObjectForm`'s form-type dispatch into `FormSection`/`SectionDivider` — closing a gap where section wrappers couldn't be customized from schema despite `FormSection` itself already supporting it.

## 11.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fffd3d: Client-side data-invalidation bus — refresh data, don't rebuild UI (objectui#2269 P1).

  - `@object-ui/react` gains the bus: `notifyDataChanged({objectName, recordId?})`, `useDataInvalidation(objectName, recordId?)` (reader nonce), `subscribeDataChanges`, and `useMutationInvalidationBridge(dataSource)` which fans every dataSource write (`MutationEvent`) onto the bus. The bus also dispatches the legacy `objectui:related-changed` window event, so pre-bus listeners keep working.
  - The `key={refreshKey}` remount of `RecordDetailView` (AppContent) and the `key={actionRefreshKey}` remount of `DetailView` (RecordDetailView) are GONE: record data now refetches in place via the bus — scroll, collapsed sections, tabs and in-progress inline edits survive every save/action/undo. All nine action-success bumps became precisely-scoped `notifyDataChanged` calls; undo/redo use the operation's own `objectName`/`recordId`.
  - `RelatedCountStore` is wired to the bus (tab count badges refetch after any change to their object) and its `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot is now a monotonic version — previously it returned the same `Map` reference, so `emit()` never re-rendered subscribers and invalidations left badges stale; `useRelatedCountVersion()` is exported and drives the probe effect's re-fetch.
  - app-shell also gains the reserved URL-param registry (`urlParams.ts` — `form`/`formObject`/`formLink`/`tab`/`recordId`/`palette`/`shortcuts` constants replace scattered string literals) and AGENTS.md Commandment #8 (UI-state classification: state that must survive a data refresh may never live only in an uncontrolled component).

- 9255686: Record detail tabs are URL-addressable (`?tab=`) and survive subtree remounts (objectui#2257, ADR-0054 C3).

  - `buildDefaultTabs` emits STABLE semantic tab values (`details` / `related:<child>` / `related` / `activity` / `history`) instead of leaving the renderer to synthesize index-derived ones.
  - `PageTabsRenderer` honors `item.value`, a host-provided `schema.defaultTab` (validated against actual tabs) and `schema.onTabChange`; index fallback kept for authored schemas without values.
  - app-shell `RecordDetailView` restores the active tab from `?tab=` and writes it back with `replace` (tab switches never stack history), via the pure `withPageTabsUrlSync` page-tree injector (never mutates authored/memoized page schemas). Legacy `DetailView.autoTabs` wired to the same contract (`defaultTab`/`onTabChange`).
  - Fixes the tab strip resetting to Details after save-refresh remounts (`refreshKey`-style) and dev-StrictMode URL churn; enables `?tab=` deep links; invalid values fall back to Details.

## 11.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 1948c5b: fix(plugin-grid): keep the grid's row selection in sync when a bulk-action dialog closes

  Closing a bulk-action result dialog (e.g. 派工 / 下推) on **Done** cleared
  ObjectGrid's `selectedRows` — which drives the selection toolbar — but never
  touched the DataTable's internal checkbox state. Two visible problems:

  - **Desync on success.** The toolbar disappeared while every row stayed visibly
    ticked, because the checkboxes are table-internal state the grid couldn't
    reach.

  - **Lost selection on total failure.** When the run failed for _every_ row
    (0 succeeded — a precondition error, say), the toolbar still vanished,
    stranding the user with no way to retry the exact rows they'd picked.

  The dialog-close handler now gates the reset on `result.succeeded > 0`: a total
  failure keeps both the selection _and_ the toolbar (and skips the phantom
  refetch) so the user can fix the cause and retry. When it does reset, a new
  `selectionResetKey` prop on DataTable clears the internal checkbox selection in
  lockstep with the toolbar, so the two never drift apart.

- bce581a: Fix dependent (cascading) lookups: unlock on parent selection and enforce the
  cascade filter on every candidate surface (#2215).

  Two breaks made `depends_on` unusable end to end:

  - **The gate never unlocked in create mode.** `LookupField` resolved dependent
    values from `ctx.formValues` — a member `SchemaRendererContext` never had —
    and nothing injected the `dependentValues` prop, so with a fresh record
    (`ctx.data = {}`) the child lookup stayed disabled no matter what the user
    picked in the parent field. The form renderer now injects its live form
    values (the same reactive snapshot that drives field rules) as
    `dependentValues` for data-source fields.
  - **The Level-2 table picker bypassed the cascade.** The `depends_on` chain
    only reached the quick-select popover filter; `RecordPickerDialog` (and the
    search-first `PeoplePicker`) received just `lookup_filters`, listing the full
    unfiltered record set. Both pickers now take a `baseFilter` — a hard
    `$filter` constraint merged after `lookupFilters` and user filter-bar input,
    so it can never be widened back out — and `LookupField` passes the dependent
    chain there, shares the same filter with the popover query, and disables the
    browse-all button while dependencies are missing.

- c38d107: Fix view-level `FormField.visibleOn` (CEL) never taking effect (#2212).

  The spec ships `visibleOn` as an Expression object `{ dialect: 'cel', source }`
  (what the `P` template emits) or a bare string, but the whole chain dropped it:

  - `sectionFields.ts` / `ObjectForm.tsx` only accepted the bare-string shape and
    attached a dead `visible()` closure no renderer ever called — the Expression
    object shape was silently discarded.
  - The form renderer destructured `visibleOn` out of the field config and never
    evaluated it.
  - `RecordFormPage` dropped a `simple` form view's `sections` entirely, so
    page-mode create/edit fell back to the raw schema (every field, no authored
    selection/grouping) while the modal path honored the same view.
  - `ObjectForm`'s grouped-sections path matched section fields by name only,
    dropping per-field `visibleOn` overrides.

  `visibleOn` now flows through normalization verbatim (both wire shapes) and is
  evaluated reactively by the form renderer with the canonical expression engine
  (`evalFieldPredicate` — same engine, record scope, and fail-open semantics as
  field-level `visibleWhen`; both predicates must allow a field for it to show).
  Sectioned/flat normalization also copies field-level `visibleWhen` /
  `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` rules it previously lost.

- 7782698: fix(components): page:header record title honours `nameField` via the unified ADR-0079 resolver

  The default console record detail page renders the synthesized `page:header`
  (`buildDefaultPageSchema`, renderViaSchema default-on), whose record-chip title
  chain probed `objSchema.primaryField` (not a spec property — always undefined),
  `titleFormat`, then hardcoded `name`/`full_name`/`title`/`subject`/
  `display_name`/`label` record keys. It never consulted the object's declared
  `nameField`/`displayNameField`, so an object titled by e.g. `subject` rendered
  `<ObjectLabel> <id-prefix>` as its H1 instead of the record's real name.

  `PageHeaderRenderer` now resolves through `getRecordDisplayName(objSchema, data,
{ deriveFromRecordKeys: false })` after the author overrides and before the
  legacy probes — mirroring `DetailView.resolveDisplayTitle` so both headers
  agree. `RecordDetailView`'s `primaryField` derivation and
  `buildDefaultPageSchema`'s highlight-strip dedup also honour
  `nameField`/`displayNameField`.

- e84d64d: Block record-scoped toolbar actions launched with zero rows selected (#2210).

  A flow/script action that also mounts on list rows (`locations` includes
  `list_item`) has no record to run on when triggered from the list toolbar with
  nothing selected — pre-fix the wizard opened anyway, collected input, and died
  at its first record-bound node ("Update requires an ID or options.multi=true").
  The console runtime now blocks up front with "select a row first", mirroring
  the existing multi-selection guard. Pure object-level toolbar actions
  (`locations: ['list_toolbar']` only) keep triggering without a record.

  The action renderers (button/icon/menu/group) now forward the `locations`
  declaration to the ActionRunner — previously it was dropped by their
  allow-list payloads, so the runtime could not tell the two shapes apart.

## 11.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d23d6eb: Three-tier AI page authoring: `kind:'html'` and a trusted `kind:'react'` tier.

  - **`@object-ui/react-runtime`** (new) — the trusted runtime-React tier for
    `kind:'react'` pages (vendored react-runner: Sucrase transpile + scope-eval,
    no sandbox). Renders real JSX/TSX (any HTML + JS + hooks/useState/map/onClick)
    in the main React tree with an injected scope (React, the public data blocks,
    page data) and a built-in error boundary.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new runtime capability gate (`enableCapability` /
    `disableCapability` / `isCapabilityEnabled`, `CAP_REACT_PAGES`). `react-pages`
    defaults **ON** (the platform trusts reviewed, draft-gated authors); a
    deployment turns it OFF server-side (the runtime injects the disable global
    when `OS_DISABLE_REACT_PAGES` is set). Never controlled from authored metadata.
  - **`@object-ui/components`** — PageRenderer now routes `kind:'react'`
    (capability-gated, lazy-loads the runtime) and renders `kind:'html'` (the
    former `kind:'jsx'`, still accepted as a deprecated alias). The `html` tier
    now resolves the full safe native HTML tag set (h1–h6, p, a, ul/ol/li, img,
    blockquote, pre, strong/em, …) so authored HTML lives up to its name.

### Patch Changes

- d88c8ec: fix(data-table): surface inline-edit save failures instead of swallowing them

  A rejected inline-edit save (e.g. a 400 validation failure like an invalid
  status transition) was caught with only `console.error` — the toolbar stayed
  stuck, the cell kept the unsaved value, and the author got no feedback. Now the
  data-table shows the server's reason in the toolbar (with an alert icon) and
  tints the affected row(s) destructive so it's clear which rows didn't persist.
  The pending edit is kept for retry; the error clears on a successful save or on
  cancel. Adds the `table.saveFailed` string across all locales.

- b7237bb: fix(components): keep MobileDialogContent open when interacting with a portalled dropdown

  Radix Select / Popover / DropdownMenu render their flyout into a portal at
  `document.body`, outside the dialog's DOM. Clicking an empty part of an open
  dropdown registered as an "interact outside" and closed the entire dialog
  (create/edit forms). `MobileDialogContent` now guards `onInteractOutside`:
  interactions whose real target is inside a Radix popper layer are ignored
  (the popper dismisses itself), while a genuine backdrop click still closes the
  dialog as before.

### Minor Changes

- a00e16d: feat: evaluate CEL `disabled` on action buttons + record-page Undo wiring

  - **components (page header)**: the `record_header` action toolbar now evaluates
    a CEL `disabled` predicate against the record (boolean was the only honoured
    form before), mirroring its existing `visible` evaluation. An action can now
    grey out conditionally (e.g. "Reassign" on a converted lead) instead of only
    hiding via `visible`.
  - **plugin-grid (row menu)**: `RowActionMenu` items likewise evaluate `disabled`
    (boolean or CEL against the row), and skip the click when disabled.
  - **components (action-button)**: forward `undoable` / `recordIdField` when
    executing, so undoable update actions keep their Undo affordance through the
    `action:button` path.
  - **app-shell (RecordDetailView)**: mount `useGlobalUndo` and wire the record
    action runtime's success toast to offer "Undo" for `undoable` actions
    (capturing the changed fields' prior values from the loaded record).
  - **plugin-detail (record:quick_actions)**: the widget's buttons now evaluate a
    CEL `disabled` and show a spinner + disable while running.

- 90acb7f: Master-detail subform + lightweight list primitives (SDUI).

  - `MasterDetailForm` (`object-master-detail-form`): enter a parent record and its child line items together; client-orchestrated transactional create (parent → FK → bulk children → rollup → cleanup). Enterprise-convention layout (header on top, line grid, single Save bar at the bottom).
  - `LineItemsField` editable child grid (line numbers, right-aligned numerics, running total) and `LineItemsPanel` (`record:line_items`) for detail-page inline edit.
  - `element:definition-list` and `element:repeater` — lightweight, low-chrome list primitives for simple data.

### Patch Changes

- ddbe4a2: B2 step 3: client-side field-level conditional rules (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`). The form renderer now evaluates these CEL predicates reactively against the live record and gates each field's visibility, read-only state, and required-ness accordingly. Evaluation delegates to the canonical `@objectstack/formula` `ExpressionEngine` — the _same_ dialect the server enforces (`requiredWhen` in the rule-validator, `readonlyWhen` in `stripReadonlyWhenFields`) — so the UX and the persisted verdict always agree. New core helpers `evalFieldPredicate` / `resolveFieldRuleState` (zero-React, fail-open). `FormField` gains `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` (+ deprecated `conditionalRequired` alias), and `ObjectForm` carries them through from object metadata.
- 2d47e94: B2 follow-ups (A): field conditional rules in inline grids + submit-time enforcement.

  - **Grids**: a line-item column's `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` CEL rule is now honored per row — `deriveMasterDetail` carries the props onto the `GridColumn` and `GridField` evaluates them against each row via `resolveFieldRuleState` (a `readonlyWhen`-TRUE cell locks; a `requiredWhen`-TRUE empty cell flags inline-invalid). Rules are row-scoped (`record.*`); the core helpers gained an optional `scope` (and `GridField` a `contextRecord` prop) so a future header-driven lock can bind `parent.*` — that wiring is deferred (it needs the master-detail header's re-renders isolated).
  - **Submit enforcement**: `requiredWhen` already drove react-hook-form's `required` rule, so submit is blocked with a field error when the predicate is TRUE and the value is empty. Added a reactive cleanup so a stale _required_ error clears when the predicate flips FALSE (and all errors clear when a field is hidden by `visibleWhen`).

- 6c0c92c: fix(app-shell): command palette idempotent open + stable locators (ADR-0054 Phase 1)

  The top-bar "Search… ⌘K" button now opens the command palette directly via a
  shared, idempotent `openCommandPalette()` instead of re-dispatching a synthetic
  `⌘K` `KeyboardEvent` — so it works under automation and in ⌘K-reserving
  browsers. Open state is URL-addressable (`?palette=1`, `?cmdk=1` alias), making
  the palette deep-linkable and restore-on-reload. The dialog and header trigger
  emit stable `data-testid` locators (`overlay:command-palette`,
  `action:command-palette:open`) plus an ARIA name. New `useCommandPalette()` hook
  and `CommandPaletteProvider`; `CommandDialog` gains a `contentProps` passthrough
  for the dialog locator/ARIA. Implements invariants C1/C3/C4 of the UI
  testability contract.

- ad8ade6: feat(components): metadata-derived field locators on generated forms (ADR-0054 Phase 4)

  The form renderer now emits a stable `data-testid="field:{objectName}.{field}"`
  (plus `data-field`) on every field wrapper, derived from the form's `objectName`
  and each field's name — closing the locator gap at the source so every generated
  form (`ObjectForm`/`ModalForm`/`DrawerForm`/`SplitForm`/`WizardForm`) inherits
  testable fields with zero per-app work (ADR-0054 C4). `FormSchema` gains an
  optional `objectName`; the object prefix is omitted (`field:{field}`) when a form
  has none. `FormItem` now accepts `data-*` attributes.

- 2eb3096: fix(form): stop `form.reset()` from wiping user input on re-render

  The form renderer reset react-hook-form whenever the `defaultValues` **object
  identity** changed:

  ```ts
  useEffect(() => {
    form.reset(defaultValues);
  }, [defaultValues]);
  ```

  Callers commonly pass a freshly-built `defaultValues` object every render, so an
  unrelated parent re-render reset the form and discarded whatever the user had
  typed. This broke master-detail "Create": a re-render between the submit click
  and the (deferred) `requestSubmit` blanked the form, so RHF then failed
  required-field validation on the now-empty fields and nothing was submitted —
  the "click Create, nothing happens" report.

  The effect now resets only when `defaultValues` actually **changes by value**
  (JSON-compared), so a genuine change (e.g. an edit-mode record finishing
  loading) still resets while identity churn is ignored.

- 7913390: fix(master-detail): never silent on save — feedback, reset, and a duplicate-submit guard

  `MasterDetailForm`'s "Create" submitted successfully but gave **no feedback**: no toast, no form reset, no navigation. A successful create looked broken, and re-clicking created duplicate records.

  - On success: a `toast.success`, and on create the form clears (line items reset + parent `<ObjectForm>` remounts) ready for the next entry. A page-supplied `onSuccess` still runs afterwards (e.g. to navigate).
  - On failure (validation / network / atomic rollback): a `toast.error` surfaces the message instead of failing silently.
  - In-flight guard: the Create button shows "Saving…" and is disabled while a submit is running, preventing duplicate submissions, with a safety release if client-side validation blocks the submit.
  - `@object-ui/components` now re-exports `toast` (alongside `Toaster`) from its sonner wrapper.

  Tests: two new `MasterDetailForm` tests assert success → toast + form clear, and failure → error toast.

- bd8b054: fix(currency): resolve the tenant default currency across the long-tail renderers

  Phase 2b of the currency-resolution work (ADR-0053). The cell/field renderers
  already funnelled through `resolveFieldCurrency` + `useLocalization` (#1856),
  but the rest of the renderers still hard-coded `USD` or read only one of
  `currency`/`defaultCurrency`. They now share the same resolution chain — explicit
  field currency -> `currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` -> legacy `defaultCurrency` ->
  tenant `localization.currency` -> plain number:

  - `plugin-dashboard` `ObjectMetricWidget` (inferred currency), `ObjectDataTable`
    (symbol-format fallback).
  - `plugin-grid` `useColumnSummary` (footer agrees with the cells) and
    `ObjectGrid` (compact amount + name-inferred currency cells).
  - `plugin-detail` `DetailView` summary metrics.
  - `plugin-gantt` `ObjectGantt` currency tooltips.
  - `components` `element:number` (`format: 'currency'`) — tenant default instead
    of a baked-in `USD`, and renders with the tenant locale.

  `resolveFieldCurrency` now lives in `@object-ui/i18n` (co-located with
  `useLocalization`, which supplies the tenant default); `@object-ui/fields`
  re-exports it, so the existing import path is unchanged. No behavior change when
  no tenant currency is configured — a field that declares its own currency, or a
  deployment with no `localization.currency`, renders exactly as before.

- 2270239: feat: scoped style-object rendering (ADR-0065)

  A metadata node may carry `responsiveStyles` (per-breakpoint CSS-property maps);
  `SchemaRenderer` compiles it to **id-scoped CSS** injected as a `<style>` tag and
  appends a scope class to the node. Build-independent (arbitrary values + design
  tokens pass through verbatim — no Tailwind JIT), collision-free (per-node scope,
  unlayered so it beats base utilities), responsive-correct (model breakpoint maps
  → generated `@media`, never `md:` variant classes). Adds `compileScopedStyles`/
  `scopeClassFor`/`hasResponsiveStyles` to `@object-ui/core` and an SDUI design-token
  palette (`--space-*`, `--surface`, `--brand`, …) to the theme. Mirrors Builder.io.

- 8d1195d: Fix `type: 'url'` actions so they actually reach the backend in split-origin dev setups, and so reveal-once result dialogs render.

  - `ActionRunner.executeUrl`: when context provides `apiBase`, relative `/api/...`, `/_auth/...`, and `/_account/...` URLs are now promoted to absolute (`${apiBase}${path}`) before navigation. Same-origin API paths (with or without `apiBase`) trigger a full-page `window.location.href` rather than React-Router push — this is required for server-side OAuth redirect dances (e.g. better-auth `/sign-in/social`) that React Router would otherwise swallow into the SPA's fallback route.
  - `ActionRunner.buildInterpolationContext`: surfaces `ctx.apiBase` for action targets that want to template it explicitly.
  - `ObjectView`: passes `apiBase: import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL` into the toolbar `ActionProvider` context so the above resolves.
  - `action-button` and `action-menu` renderers now forward `resultDialog` when invoking the runner. Previously this field was silently dropped by an explicit whitelist, breaking every "show once, then hide" flow (2FA QR/backup codes, OAuth client_secret, regenerated tokens).

### Minor Changes

- 87bc8ff: `DataEmptyState` (re-exported as `EmptyState`) is now the canonical
  platform primitive for "no records / no data" states. Two new props
  keep it flexible enough to absorb the hand-rolled variants that lived
  in `plugin-list`, `plugin-kanban`, and `plugin-dashboard`:

  - `showIcon?: boolean` — drops the icon container entirely. Used by the
    kanban board-level empty banner, which is a status banner rather than
    a true empty-state.
  - `iconWrapperClassName?: string` — overrides the default muted rounded
    square. Pass `""` to render the icon raw (used by `ListView`'s grid
    empty state, which uses a large standalone glyph).

  Adopters:

  - `plugin-list` (`ListView` grid empty-state) — preserves the existing
    large icon, title, message, add-record button and `data-testid`s,
    but delegates the structural markup to `DataEmptyState`.
  - `plugin-kanban` (board-level "all columns empty" banner) — keeps the
    dashed border + `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"` semantics.
  - `plugin-dashboard` (`PivotTable` zero-rows branch) — keeps the
    custom 4-quad SVG icon and `pivot-empty-state` test id.

  No public-API change for consumers; the older inline markup is gone
  but the rendered output, translation keys, and test hooks are
  preserved.

- a8d12ec: `page:header` subtitle and title-format interpolation now translates
  enum field values through the i18n option-label dictionary.

  A schema like `subtitle: "{industry} · {type}"` previously rendered the
  raw enum values (`"technology · customer"`) regardless of locale or
  authored option labels. The interpolator now looks up the current
  record's `objectSchema.fields` and routes each token through
  `useSafeFieldLabel().fieldOptionLabel(...)`, so the same template
  renders as `"科技 · 正式客户"` in zh-CN and `"Technology · Customer"`
  in en — without authors having to write per-locale subtitle templates.

  The change is transparent for tokens that resolve to non-enum field
  values; only fields with an `options` array are remapped.

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8955b9c: fix(empty): render `action` schema via `SchemaRenderer` instead of leaking the raw object

  The `empty` renderer was spreading the schema's `action` prop straight onto
  `DataEmptyState`, which renders `{action}` as a child. That worked for React
  nodes but blew up on production builds when the docs site fed it a schema
  shape like `action: { type: 'button', label: 'Create', variant: 'default' }`
  (error: "Objects are not valid as a React child").

  The renderer now passes `schema.action` through `SchemaRenderer` to turn it
  into a real React element, and explicitly strips `action`/`icon` from the
  spread so schema-shaped objects don't reach DOM attributes.

### Minor Changes

- cf30cc2: Polish Lightning record detail page layout.
  - `record:details` sections now render with Card chrome by default when a `title` is present, restoring visual grouping that was missing on pages like the opportunity detail page.
  - Section labels can be translated via the `{ns}.objects.{objectName}._sections.{name}.label` convention. Author each section with a stable `name` (e.g. `info`, `forecast`) and the renderer picks up the locale-specific label automatically. Falls back to the literal `label` when no translation exists.
  - The `page:header` action toolbar now collapses into a `⋯` overflow menu when more than two actions are present. The first business action stays inline; secondary system actions (Edit / Share / Delete) move into the menu, with destructive styling applied to Delete.
  - Header action labels resolve via the `{ns}.objects.{objectName}._actions.{name}.label` convention.
  - Removed the meaningless field-count Badge from collapsible section headers (the `2` chip next to "Description"). Field-count metadata wasn't useful in the header and added visual noise.
  - Synth-path `sys_delete` now carries `variant: 'destructive'` so the overflow menu can color it appropriately.

### Patch Changes

- bd8447d: Three platform-wide detail polish items.

  **Tighter page rhythm**

  - Outer `PageRenderer` padding `p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8` → `p-3 md:p-4 lg:p-6`
    and outer body wrap `space-y-8` → `space-y-6` so list / detail / home
    pages share the same edge rhythm. Cuts ~16px of edge slack on lg.

  **Highlights KPI treatment**

  - `HeaderHighlight` now renders numeric / currency / percent / decimal
    values as KPI numbers (`text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold tabular-nums`)
    instead of the uniform `text-sm font-semibold`, so amount / probability
    / count fields read as headline stats — Salesforce-style key facts.

  **Discussion footer upgrade**

  - `RecordActivityTimeline` now uses `RichTextCommentInput` (bold / italic /
    list / code, `@`-mention autocomplete, preview toggle, Send) instead of
    a bare `<textarea>`.
  - `DiscussionContext` gains an optional `mentionSuggestions` array that
    hosts can wire (e.g. team member directory). Falls back to free-text
    `@mention` when omitted.
  - `RecordChatterPanel` threads `mentionSuggestions` through both inline
    and sidebar positions.

- fbd5052: Tighten record-detail visual rhythm. Section card titles were rendering at
  Shadcn's default `text-2xl` which dominated the page; the related-list
  accordion in flush mode dropped all per-item borders so the collapsed
  "Quotes / Products / Open Tasks" triggers stacked with zero visual
  separation.

  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` `DetailSection`: override the `CardTitle`
    className to `text-base font-semibold tracking-tight`, slim down
    `CardHeader` padding (`py-3 px-4 sm:py-4 sm:px-6`) and `CardContent`
    vertical padding so titles + content read as a single tight block
    rather than a billboard. Demoted the section description from `text-sm
mt-1.5` to `text-xs mt-1` for the same reason.
  - `@object-ui/components` `PageAccordionRenderer`: in the default
    `flush` variant restore a subtle `border-b last:border-b-0` divider
    between accordion items so collapsed siblings get a separator, and
    style the trigger as `text-sm font-semibold tracking-tight
hover:no-underline` (Shadcn's hover-underline default looks busy on
    CRM-style related-list lists).

- d51a577: feat(platform): Discussion attachments + @mention directory + Reference Rail aside

  - **Discussion attachments** — `RichTextCommentInput` now accepts an `extraSlot`
    and a `canSubmitEmpty` flag so hosts can mount the existing
    `CommentAttachment` composer beneath the editor without forking the toolbar.
    `RecordActivityTimeline` plumbs the attachments through
    `DiscussionContext.onUploadAttachments` and submits attachment-only comments.
  - **@mention directory** — `DiscussionContext` gains a `mentionSuggestions`
    field; `RecordDetailView` populates it from the host `sys_user` collection so
    `@` autocomplete in the composer now resolves against real users.
  - **Reference Rail** — New `record:reference_rail` renderer + a dedicated
    `aside` region emitted by `buildDefaultPageSchema` whenever a record has
    ≥ 2 related lists. The rail surfaces a Salesforce/HubSpot-style snapshot
    of related collections (count badge + top 3 records) on `xl+` viewports.
  - **Layout** — `PageRenderer`'s structured-layout `<aside>` wrappers now honor
    `aside.className`, letting schemas attach responsive utilities like
    `hidden xl:flex` to the rail region.

- d1ec6a2: Fold inline-edit into the page-header overflow menu (HubSpot/Lightning
  pattern) and remove the orphan "Edit fields" toolbar row that previously
  floated between the tab strip and the first detail section.

  - `@object-ui/app-shell` `RecordDetailView`: injects a new `sys_inline_edit`
    system action that appears in the ⋯ overflow menu and dispatches a
    `objectui:record:inline-edit-toggle` window CustomEvent (filtered by
    recordId + objectName).
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` `DetailView`: listens for that event to
    toggle inline-edit mode; the in-page toolbar now renders only during
    active editing / save error / locked states, so the idle layout flows
    tabs → first section card with no orphan row.
  - `@object-ui/components` layout containers: extended `KNOWN_LABEL_DICT`
    with zh-CN + zh-TW translations for common CRM related-list labels
    (Quotes / Products / Contacts / Accounts / Leads / Opportunities /
    Cases / Campaigns / Approvals / Documents / Emails / Calls / Meetings
    / Open Tasks / Closed Tasks), so authored English labels auto-translate
    in `page:accordion` / `page:tabs` items.

- d548d6b: Unify empty-state visuals across timeline + registered `empty` renderer.

  - `RecordActivityTimeline` and `ActivityTimeline` now use `DataEmptyState`
    instead of a bare `<p>` so empty timelines match list/related-list visuals
    (muted icon badge + centered copy).
  - The `ui:empty` schema renderer now delegates to `DataEmptyState`, giving
    schema-driven empty regions the same chrome as ad-hoc consumers.

### Major Changes

- bb2ea48: **Phase O.0 — fix: related-list shows wrong records (critical data bug)**

  `RelatedList` previously called `dataSource.find(api)` with no filter
  when auto-fetching, so every Related tab dumped the entire target
  object table instead of the records that actually reference the
  current parent (e.g. an Account showed every Contact in the system,
  not only contacts of that account).

  Two coupled fixes:

  1. `RelatedList` now requires `parentId` + `referenceField` to auto-
     fetch. When both are present it calls `dataSource.find(api,
{ $filter: { [referenceField]: parentId } })`. When either is
     missing it renders the empty state and logs a developer warning —
     never silently fetches the whole object.
  2. `RelatedCountStore` was sending the probe query as `{ where, limit }`
     which most data-source adapters silently ignored (the codebase
     convention is `{ $filter, $top }`). The tab-count badges were
     therefore showing the global object count, not the parent-scoped
     count. Switched to `$filter` / `$top` to match.

  `record:related_list` renderer threads `ctx.recordId` through as
  `parentId`; no schema author changes required.

  **Breaking:** custom callers that depended on `RelatedList` fetching
  the entire object table when `referenceField` is omitted will need to
  either pass `data` explicitly or supply both `parentId` and
  `referenceField`. The previous behaviour was a bug, not a feature.

### Minor Changes

- 8930b15: feat(detail): close the gap between Page-assigned and default record detail pages (Track 1)

  Custom Lightning-style record detail pages (assigned via `assignedPage` /
  `Page` schemas) used to feel meaningfully poorer than the auto-generated
  default detail view. They were missing cross-cutting affordances and
  shipped with English-only tab labels and heavy bordered section cards
  even when the host locale was Chinese. Track 1 closes the visible gap:

  - **app-shell `RecordDetailView`**: the `assignedPage` branch now wears
    the same chrome as the default branch — lifecycle managed-by badge
    and presence avatars in the top-right, `MetadataPanel` debug panel,
    `ActionConfirmDialog` / `ActionParamDialog`, and an auto-appended
    `RecordChatterPanel` at the bottom of the page. Authors opt out of
    the auto-discussion with `assignedPage.disableDiscussion = true`.
  - **plugin-detail `record:details`**: defaults to `inlineEdit: true` so
    fields are click-to-edit just like the default page, and synthesises
    sections with `showBorder: false` by default so a Lightning page
    doesn't double-wrap every block in a heavy Card.
  - **components `page:tabs` / `page:accordion`**: well-known English
    labels (Details / Related / Activity / History / Notes / Files /
    Tasks / Events / Attachments / Chatter / Discussion / Comments /
    Overview / Summary) auto-translate to Chinese (`zh-CN` / `zh-TW`)
    via a built-in dictionary keyed off `document.documentElement.lang`.
    Authors supplying explicit localised labels (string or
    `{ default, zh-CN, ... }`) are not affected.
  - **i18n provider**: applies the initial language to
    `document.documentElement.lang` on mount (i18next does not fire
    `languageChanged` for the bootstrap language), so locale-aware
    renderers downstream see the right value from the first render.

- 95b6b21: feat(page:header): record-aware chip + dedupe registrations (Phase D)

  The `page:header` schema renderer is the visual anchor of every custom
  record detail page (lead, opportunity, future account/contact/case).
  Before this change it had two problems that bled into every custom
  page across the product:

  1. **Quadruple registration**: `@object-ui/layout` registered both
     `page-header` and `page:header`, and `@object-ui/components`
     independently registered `page:header` (and `page:section`).
     Whichever package loaded last won the unqualified `page:header`
     lookup — visually unstable.
  2. **Bare `<h1>`** with no record affordances (no icon, ★ favourite,
     copy-id, edit, ⋯ menu) — every custom page shipped a thinner header
     than the default detail view it was meant to supersede.

  This commit:

  - Removes the `@object-ui/layout` `page:header` registration. The
    layout package keeps the legacy kebab-cased `page-header` alias only.
    The canonical renderer now lives in `@object-ui/components` and is
    always the one resolved.
  - Upgrades `PageHeaderRenderer` to render a `<RecordTitleChip>` when
    wrapped in a `RecordContext`. The chip mirrors the default detail
    header: title (resolved from `data.name` / `data.title` /
    `data.display_name`, or an interpolated `schema.title`), a favourite
    star, the object label, and a copy-record-id button. Authors opt out
    via `recordChrome: false` or hide individual affordances with
    `showStar: false` / `showCopyId: false`.
  - Extracts the chip into a new shared `RecordTitleChip` component in
    `@object-ui/components/custom`. It carries an inline zh-CN/zh-TW
    dictionary for star/copy tooltips so it stays i18n-correct without
    pulling in a translation dependency.
  - Fixes `interpolate()` so a `{account}`-style token that resolves to
    a related-record object renders as empty instead of
    `"[object Object]"`. Authors who want a field of the related record
    should use a deeper path (`{account.name}`).

  Verified at 1440×900 on `lead_detail` and `opportunity_detail`:
  both pages now show the same chip with star + copy-id and the
  opportunity highlights strip looks coherent with the chip above it.

- ddb08a7: feat(page:header,page:tabs): title fallback + single-tab strip auto-hide (Phase G slice 3 polish)

  - `page:header.resolvedTitle` now honors `objectSchema.titleFormat`
    (e.g. `{first_name} {last_name}`) and falls back through `name →
full_name → title → subject → display_name → label` before degrading
    to `${objectLabel} ${idPrefix}`. Mirrors `DetailView.resolveDisplayTitle`
    so default and synthesized record pages produce identical titles.
  - `page:tabs` hides the tab strip entirely when there's only one tab
    (a single labelled pill is visual clutter, not an affordance).
    Authors can opt back in with `properties.alwaysShowStrip: true`.
    Single-tab content margin tightens from `mt-3` to `mt-0` to remove
    the now-empty top space.

- 927187a: Phase N.1 + N.2: visual polish for record detail pages.

  **N.1 — System actions on full Lightning pages.** `PageHeaderRenderer`
  now merges `headerSystemActions` from `RecordContext` with authored
  actions (authored wins on name/id collision), so full custom pages
  (lead, opportunity, ...) once again show 编辑 / 分享 / 删除 alongside
  their authored actions. `sys_share` and `sys_delete` now use the
  `outline` variant instead of `destructive` to read better in
  multi-button clusters.

  **N.2 — Hide empty fields by default in synth detail pages.**
  `record:details` defaults `section.hideEmpty` to `true` so synthesized
  pages don't render label graveyards on first load. The "显示 N 个空字段"
  reveal toggle is preserved as the user-facing escape hatch. Authors can
  opt back into showing every field by setting `hideEmpty: false` on the
  section schema.

- bae8ba8: Phase N.3 + N.4 + N.6: record detail visual polish.

  **N.3 — Highlight strip packs left.** `HeaderHighlight` no longer
  stretches a 1-2 chip strip across the full page. Each cell is now
  `min-w-[8rem] max-w-[16rem]` and wraps via flexbox so sparse strips
  sit naturally at the left edge.

  **N.4 — De-duplicate highlight ↔ body.** `record:details` accepts a
  new `hideFields: string[]` prop. The synth pipeline auto-populates it
  with the highlight-strip field list so a field surfaced in
  `record:highlights` no longer appears a second time in the section
  grid below. Authors can also set it directly on the schema.

  **N.6 — Tab count badges only show when >0.** `page:tabs` suppresses
  the count pill when the count is exactly 0 (was rendering "0" as a
  muted badge on every empty Activity/History tab).

- b14fe09: Phase P.0 + P.5: tighten record-detail header chrome.

  - `RecordTitleChip` collapses the title row to a single baseline-aligned line — H1, eyebrow object label, copy-id, favorite star — instead of the previous two-row title + subtitle layout.
  - `record:details` extends the highlight-field dedup set to also exclude the title field resolved from `objectSchema.primaryField` (or the standard `name`/`full_name`/`title`/`subject`/`display_name`/`label` fallbacks). Removes the duplicate row that previously echoed the H1 (e.g. "客户名称: Acme Corporation") inside the field grid.

- a7bef6e: Phase P.3: anchor `page:tabs` 'line' variant with a proper underline rail.

  The Shadcn Tabs primitive defaults to a pill-card look (bg-muted,
  rounded, white-on-active). On long record-detail pages this strip
  floats unmoored — users scroll past it without realising it's a
  section anchor.

  `PageTabsRenderer` now applies an underline-style treatment to the
  default 'line' variant: the `TabsList` gets a bottom border, and each
  `TabsTrigger` renders as a transparent button with a 2px primary-color
  underline when active. 'card' and 'pill' variants are unchanged.

- 74962b0: feat(detail): record:discussion schema component + flush accordion variant

  - New `record:discussion` schema type lets authors place the record
    chatter feed anywhere in a custom Page schema. Wired through a
    shared `DiscussionContext` provider on the `assignedPage` branch
    of `RecordDetailView`; auto-append still applies when no explicit
    `record:discussion` / `record:chatter` node is present.
  - `page:accordion` gains a `variant` prop. Default `flush` strips the
    per-item border so accordion sections no longer double-wrap inner
    Card-bearing renderers (RelatedList, etc.). Authors who want the
    old visual pass `variant: 'card'`.
  - `translateLabel` now handles compound labels split by `&`, `and`,
    or `和` (e.g. `Notes & Attachments` → `备注与附件`).

- fa4c2cb: feat(detail): renderViaSchema opt-in routes default detail through SchemaRenderer (Track 3 Phase G slice 2)

  When `?renderViaSchema=1` is in the URL, or `objectDef.detail.renderViaSchema === true`,
  `RecordDetailView`'s no-assignedPage branch now synthesizes a canonical
  Page schema (`page:header` → `record:highlights` → `record:path` →
  `page:tabs(record:details)` → `record:discussion`) via
  `buildDefaultPageSchema(objectDef, { sections, highlightFields })` and
  renders it through the existing `<SchemaRenderer>` pipeline.

  This means every object without a custom assigned page can opt in to
  the same chrome (record-aware header chip, chevron path, flush
  accordion, discussion slot) that custom Lightning pages already enjoy.

  Changes:

  - `buildDefaultPageSchema` now emits `page:tabs.items` (correct shape
    for the renderer) rather than `tabs`.
  - `PageHeaderRenderer.resolvedTitle` honors `objectSchema.primaryField`
    before the legacy `name/title/display_name/label` fallbacks.
  - `RecordDetailView` rebuilds the synthesized schema with
    `detailSchema.sections` + `highlightFields` at render time so
    `record:details` inherits the same field layout the legacy
    `<DetailView>` would have produced.

  Flag is intentionally off by default — flipping the default is a
  separate explicit commit after empirical parity validation across
  multiple objects. Known gaps tracked for slice 3: titleFormat
  fallback for objects without `primaryField`, auto Activity / History
  tabs, header-action buttons.

### Patch Changes

- 765d50f: fix(components): strip dangling separators from interpolated record titles

  `page:header` now post-processes the result of interpolating a record's
  `titleFormat` through `cleanupTitleSeparators` so a missing field in the
  template doesn't leave a trailing/leading connector.

  Example: with `titleFormat: '{contract_number} - {name}'` and a contract
  whose `name` is empty, the header was rendering `CTR-0001 -` (with a
  dangling hyphen). It now renders `CTR-0001`. Also handles a missing
  middle field (`A -  - B` → `A - B`) and collapses whitespace runs.

  Supports hyphen / em-dash / en-dash / middle-dot / colon / slash / pipe
  connectors. Idempotent. Exported as `cleanupTitleSeparators` from the
  containers module; covered by 10 new unit tests.

- 3154334: fix(components): render `page:header.actions` on custom detail pages

  `PageHeaderRenderer` previously read `title`, `subtitle`, `breadcrumb`,
  `showStar`, `showCopyId` but never the `actions` array. Authored
  Lightning record pages embed action buttons directly on
  `page:header` (e.g. Lead → "Convert Lead", Opportunity → "Clone
  Opportunity"); these buttons silently disappeared.

  The renderer now reads `schema.actions ?? schema.properties?.actions`,
  filters by `locations.includes('record_header')` (default-include when
  absent), evaluates `visible` / `hidden` predicates (boolean, string,
  or `{ dialect, source }` shapes) against the live record via
  `ExpressionEvaluator`, and dispatches clicks through the
  `ActionProvider`'s shared runner — so `confirmText`, `successMessage`,
  `refreshAfter`, `flow`, navigation and modal handlers all fire.

  The `data-page-actions-slot` portal target is preserved as a fallback
  when no actions are declared in schema.

### Minor Changes

- 3ee436d: feat(components): add `RelatedCountStore` runtime cache + `useRelatedCount`
  hook (built on `useSyncExternalStore`, no new deps). Replaces
  `PageTabsRenderer`'s local per-instance `derivedCounts` state with a
  shared module-scoped store so multiple consumers of the same
  object/parent pair share a single probe.

  Wires `useBulkExecutor` to call `RelatedCountStore.invalidate(resource)`
  after any successful bulk update/delete, so related-list badges on
  parent records re-probe automatically on the next render instead of
  showing stale counts.

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b6afd1: `page:tabs` items now render their optional `icon` (lucide name) and `count`
  badge after the label. Counts >= 1000 are shortened to compact form
  (e.g. `1.2k`). Spec-aligned: `PageTabsItem.icon` and `PageTabsItem.count`.
- aa7855f: `page:tabs` now auto-derives count badges from any descendant `record:related_list`.

  For every tab item whose `count` is not set explicitly, the renderer walks the tab's children (depth-first) to find the first `record:related_list` schema node and issues a `limit:1` find through the active `dataSource` to read the matching `total`. The badge appears in the tab strip without spec authors having to wire counts manually.

  Behavior:

  - Explicit `count` in the spec always wins.
  - Probe is filtered by the parent record id via `relationshipField` when present (skipped until the parent record is loaded).
  - Best-effort: a failed probe just omits the badge — no error surface.
  - Cancellable on unmount.

### Patch Changes

- 170d89f: PageTabsRenderer auto-count now descends into accordion (`properties.items`) and sums counts when a tab contains multiple `record:related_list` widgets — matches Salesforce "Related" tab semantics. Previously only the first list was probed (or none, if wrapped in an accordion).

### Patch Changes

- 2bd45af: feat(shell): main becomes the scroll container; record tabs are sticky
  - `AppShell`'s SidebarProvider wrapper is now constrained to viewport
    height (`h-svh overflow-hidden`) instead of expanding with content via
    the default `min-h-svh`. This makes the inner `<main>` (which is
    `overflow-auto`) the actual scroll container instead of the window.
  - `RecordDetailView` page-mode container drops the redundant
    `h-full overflow-auto` (avoids nested scrollers; main owns scroll now).
  - `page:tabs` (horizontal) gets `sticky top-0 z-20` with a translucent
    backdrop so the tab strip stays visible while users scroll through
    long record pages — the Salesforce Lightning behaviour our schemas
    were already implying.

### Patch Changes

- 6b683c8: fix(detail): clean up record page rendering

  - Drop `ai:chat_window` from the protocol-component placeholder list. The
    floating chat overlay (plugin-chatbot) is the canonical AI entry point;
    inline page schemas that still reference `ai:chat_window` now surface
    as an explicit "Unknown component type" so the misconfiguration is
    fixed at the source instead of silently leaking a placeholder card.
  - `page:header` now resolves `{field.path}` tokens in `title` / `description`
    against the current record context (matching the behaviour of the
    alternative `containers.tsx` renderer). Without this, schemas like
    `title: "{first_name} {last_name}"` rendered the literal template.
  - `containers.tsx` `PageHeaderRenderer`: also read from `schema.properties.*`
    as a fallback so both inlined and raw-bag schema shapes are supported.

### Patch Changes

- 4e7bc1b: **Report editor panel overhaul**

  The report configuration panel is now safe to open on any spec-shape `Report` and only exposes fields that are actually persisted by `@objectstack/spec`.

  `@object-ui/plugin-report`:

  - Add a bidirectional `SpecFilterAdapter` so `ReportConfigPanel` can edit
    spec `FilterCondition` filters (`{field: value}`, `{field: {$op: value}}`,
    top-level `$and`/`$or`). Complex / nested filters fall back to a
    read-only banner and are preserved verbatim on save.
  - Drop sections that never round-tripped through the spec
    (`conditionalFormatting`, `sections`, `export`, `schedule`, `appearance`)
    and their helper components.
  - Add type-driven section visibility: `tabular` shows Columns/Filters,
    `summary` adds Rows + Chart, `matrix` adds Rows + Columns axis + Chart.
  - New `GroupingsBuilder` covers `groupingsDown`/`groupingsAcross` with
    `sortOrder` and date-aware `dateGranularity` controls.
  - New `ColumnsEditor` lets users reorder picked columns, override labels,
    set aggregates and choose a display format.
  - Chart subset now mirrors the spec: chart `title`, `showLegend`,
    `showDataLabels`, plus `funnel` (scatter removed).
  - Validation banner highlights missing `objectName` and missing
    rows/columns for `matrix`/`summary` reports.
  - All editor labels and hints are i18n-driven (`report.editor.*`).
  - 18 new unit tests cover the filter adapter round-trip.

  `@object-ui/components`:

  - `FilterBuilder` now guards against malformed external `value` props.
    Previously a spec-shape filter (`{is_active: true}`) would crash the
    component on first render; the builder now falls back to an empty
    AND group whenever `value` is not a valid `FilterGroup`.

  `@object-ui/i18n`:

  - Add `report.editor.*` strings to `en` and `zh`.

- 8442c05: Improve report editor panel usability based on real-user browser testing:

  - **Wider config panel** — the report editor now defaults to a `--config-panel-width`
    of 440px (up from 280px), driven by a new optional `style` prop on
    `ConfigPanelRenderer`. Long field labels, report titles, type labels, and filter
    rows no longer truncate to "Account Na" / "kup" / "ct" / 1-character widths.
  - **Disambiguated "Columns" sections** — for `summary` and `matrix` reports the
    measure list is now labelled **"Values / 度量"** (pivot-style vocabulary) instead
    of "Columns", which previously clashed with the matrix's pivot column axis
    (also called "Columns / 列"). The two sections used to be indistinguishable.
    New i18n key `report.editor.values` / `valuesHint` is shipped for all 10
    locales (en, zh, ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru).
  - **Reordered sections for matrix/summary** — the editor now surfaces _Rows_
    and _Columns_ (the pivot axes) **before** _Values_, mirroring how a business
    user thinks about a pivot table.
  - **Per-row aggregate/format headers** — each column row in `ColumnsEditor` now
    shows small "Aggregate" / "Format" labels above the respective selects, and
    the row uses a 2-line layout so the label input has its own line. The cramped
    3-dropdowns-side-by-side layout at 10px font is gone.
  - **Searchable field picker** — the "Add columns" list now has a search box,
    a `filtered / total` counter, an empty-state message, and a scrollable bordered
    container. New i18n keys: `report.editor.searchFields`,
    `report.editor.noMatchingFields`.

## 4.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 7c9b85c: Fix compatibility with the framework's normalized Expression envelope format.

  `@objectstack/spec` now emits predicate (`visible` / `enabled`) and template
  (`titleFormat`) fields as `{ dialect, source }` envelopes instead of bare
  strings. The previous implementation assumed strings and crashed the record
  detail view (`TypeError: titleFormat.replace is not a function`) and printed
  `Failed to evaluate expression: ${[object Object]}` for every action visibility
  predicate.

  - `@object-ui/core`: `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate` / `evaluateCondition` now
    unwrap Expression envelopes transparently.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `toPredicateInput()` helper to safely normalize
    `boolean | string | Expression` predicate inputs into the `${expr}` form
    expected by `useCondition`.
  - `@object-ui/components`: `action-bar`, `action-button`, `action-group`,
    `action-icon`, `action-menu` renderers use `toPredicateInput()` instead of
    template-literal interpolation that produced `${[object Object]}`.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`, `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`,
    `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/app-shell`,
    `@object-ui/console`: title-format helpers accept both legacy strings and
    the new `{ source }` envelope.

  All changes are backward-compatible — legacy bare strings continue to work.

### Patch Changes

- 925051d: fix: convert Tailwind v3 `[--var]` arbitrary value syntax to v4 `(--var)`

  Shadcn `Sidebar`, `Calendar`, `Chart`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `HoverCard`,
  `Menubar`, `Select`, `Dropdown`, `Context-Menu`, and `AppSidebar` used the
  Tailwind v3 syntax `w-[--sidebar-width]`, `origin-[--radix-...]`, etc.
  Tailwind v4 no longer interprets the bare `--xxx` inside arbitrary values
  as `var(--xxx)`, so the rule emits empty CSS — the sidebar collapses to
  0 width and overlays the main content, dropdown/popover positions fall
  back to the wrong origin, and the calendar cells lose their fixed size.

  Replaced all such occurrences with the v4 CSS-variable shorthand
  `w-(--sidebar-width)`, `origin-(--radix-...)`, etc. Existing
  `[calc(var(--xxx)*-1)]` arbitrary expressions are unaffected.

- 1b6dc64: fix: complete Tailwind v3→v4 migration cleanup
  - Rename deprecated `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0` and `flex-grow-N` →
    `grow-N` (Tailwind v4 dropped the long-form aliases). Affects
    data-table, fields/index, FileField, ChatbotEnhanced,
    FloatingChatbotPanel, ProcessDesigner, HistoryPanel, KanbanEnhanced,
    KanbanImpl, plugin-timeline index, FlowDesigner, LayoutRenderer.
  - Replace `theme(spacing.4)` inside arbitrary-value `[calc(...)]` with
    literal `1rem` in sidebar.tsx — `theme()` is deprecated in v4.
  - Remove obsolete v3-escape CSS overrides from index.css and
    sidebar-fixes.css. The component source now uses native v4 stacked
    data variants (`group-data-[state=collapsed]:group-data-[collapsible=icon]:w-(--sidebar-width-icon)`)
    which Tailwind v4 emits correctly without the manual overrides.
    Only the bespoke `.sidebar-menu-button-icon-mode*` rules are kept.

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

### Minor Changes

- f1ca238: Async streaming export — spec v4 export job lifecycle end-to-end

  For tenants with millions of records the legacy in-memory CSV/JSON export blew
  past the browser's heap. This change wires the spec v4 streaming-export
  contract through the renderer end-to-end:

  **`@object-ui/types`** — `DataSource` gains four optional methods:

  - `createExportJob(resource, request)` → `{ jobId, status, estimatedRecords, createdAt }`
  - `getExportJobProgress(jobId)` → `{ status, processedRecords, totalRecords, percentComplete, downloadUrl, … }`
  - `cancelExportJob(jobId)` (optional)
  - `getExportJobDownloadUrl(jobId)` (optional — for short-lived signed URLs)

  Mirror the spec v4 `CreateExportJobRequest` / `ExportJobProgress` shapes; types
  remain dependency-free.

  **`@object-ui/components`** — new public API:

  - `useExportJob({ dataSource, pollIntervalMs, onComplete, onError })` — owns the
    full polling loop, terminal-state handling, cancel, and download.
  - `<ExportProgressDialog open onOpenChange job filename closeAfterDownloadMs />` —
    determinate or indeterminate progress bar, byte/record counts, Cancel while
    running, Download on completion, error banner on failure.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-grid`** — `ObjectGrid` now auto-detects async export
  support: when the `DataSource` exposes `createExportJob` + `getExportJobProgress`
  (and the schema isn't using inline `value` data) the export popover routes
  through the streaming path with a progress dialog. Otherwise it falls back to
  the existing client-side blob path. Set `exportOptions.streaming = false` to
  force the legacy path.

### Patch Changes

- a2d7023: End-user feature batch — forms, designer history, import/export, and PWA offline sync.

  **Forms (`@object-ui/fields`, `@object-ui/providers`)**

  - `FileField`: native `<input capture="environment">` camera capture for mobile devices, plus a uploading-progress indicator driven by `UploadProvider`.
  - `ImageField`: per-image inline crop/rotate via the lazy-loaded `ImageCropperDialog` (canvas-based, zero new deps).
  - New `UploadProvider` in `@object-ui/providers` with pluggable adapters for S3 and Azure Blob (plus the default object-URL adapter for local previews). XHR-based with progress, abort, and retry.
  - `LookupField`: `lookup.dependsOn: string | string[]` to chain dependent lookups (e.g. State depends on Country); the trigger is gated until parent values are present and the OData `$filter` is built automatically.

  **Container-aware widget widths (`@object-ui/components`)**

  - New `useResizeObserver(ref)` hook exposing `{ width, height }` of any element. SSR-safe; reads the initial size via `getBoundingClientRect`.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-kanban` now react to their container size instead of `window.innerWidth`, so they behave correctly inside split panels and dashboards.

  **Designer history (`@object-ui/plugin-designer`)**

  - `useUndoRedo` (and therefore `useDesignerHistory`) gains `persistKey` + `storage` options to round-trip the undo/redo stack through `sessionStorage`, plus a `clearPersisted()` cleanup helper. Drafts now survive accidental tab refreshes.
  - New `<HistoryPanel>` component renders the timeline visually with one-click jump-to-checkpoint via the new `jumpTo(index)` API.

  **Import wizard (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**

  - Saved column-mapping templates: name, save, re-apply, and delete via a new template bar in the mapping step. Persisted under `objectui:import-templates:${objectName}` (override via `templateStorageKey` / `templateStorage`).
  - Inline validation correction: cells with errors in the preview step are now editable; corrections feed straight into the import without requiring a re-upload, with green-bar status indicators for fixed rows.

  **PWA offline sync (`@object-ui/mobile`)**

  - New `MemoryOfflineQueue` / `IndexedDbOfflineQueue` (`createOfflineQueue()` picks the best backend) backed by IndexedDB.
  - `createOfflineDataSource(inner, { queue })` wraps any DataSource so mutations issued while offline (or that fail with a network-style error) are queued and replayed in order on reconnect. Includes `replay()`, `drop()`, `clear()`, `pending()`, an `onChange` notifier, and an opt-in `resolveConflict` hook for stale-write conflicts.
  - New `useOfflineSync(source)` hook exposes `{ isOnline, pending, isReplaying, replay, drop, clear }` and auto-replays on the browser's `online` event.
  - `getServiceWorkerSource(opts)` emits a customisable Service Worker that pre-caches the app shell, applies network-first to API requests, and broadcasts `REPLAY_QUEUE` to clients on Background Sync. `requestBackgroundSync(tag)` registers a one-shot sync from the page.

- de881ef: Mobile UX round 3 — Form: sticky save bar, fullscreen long-text editor, and auto-stepper for long forms on small viewports.

  **`@object-ui/types`** — `ObjectFormSchema.mobile` (new) lets a single form opt into all three behaviours:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'object-form',
    objectName: 'leads',
    mode: 'create',
    mobile: {
      stickyActions: true,        // pin Submit/Cancel to bottom on phones
      stepper: 'auto',            // long forms render one field per step
      stepperMinFields: 8,        // …but only past this many fields
      stepperFieldsPerStep: 1,    // … (default 1)
      fullscreenLongText: true,   // textarea fields get an "expand" affordance
    },
  }
  ```

  `FormSchema.mobileStickyActions` (new) is the lower-level escape hatch — applied automatically when `mobile.stickyActions` is set on `ObjectFormSchema`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-form`** — `ObjectForm` now:

  - propagates `mobile.fullscreenLongText` to every textarea/markdown/html field as `mobile_fullscreen: true`,
  - sets `mobileStickyActions` on the inner form schema and adds `pb-20` padding so content isn't covered by the fixed bar,
  - when `mobile.stepper === true` (or `'auto'` + `useIsMobile()` + > `stepperMinFields` fields), routes the flat field list through the existing `WizardForm` with synthetic single-field "steps" — keeping per-step validation and the existing `Next`/`Back`/`Submit` flow.

  **`@object-ui/components`** — the registered `form` renderer adds:

  - a `mobileStickyActions` opt-in that turns the action row into a `position: sticky; bottom: 0` bar on small viewports, and
  - an inline `FullscreenTextarea` wrapper used when no field-package widget is registered, providing the same expand-button + edit-dialog UX so the feature works even in lighter setups.

  **`@object-ui/fields`** — `TextAreaField` ships the actual fullscreen UX: a top-right `Maximize2` button opens a near-fullscreen `Dialog` containing a full-height `Textarea` with a draft-then-commit save model (Cancel reverts).

  All three behaviours are off by default — existing forms render unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- b429568: chore(examples): relocate console templates under `examples/`

  The fork-ready ObjectStack console template moved from `apps/console-starter`
  to `examples/console-starter`, so `apps/` only contains real deployable
  products (`console`, `site`). The third-party integration demo
  `examples/minimal-console` was renamed to `examples/byo-backend-console`
  to make its "bring-your-own backend" purpose explicit and to remove the
  naming collision with the starter template. Source comments and READMEs in
  `@object-ui/app-shell` and `@object-ui/components` have been updated to
  point at the new paths; no runtime behaviour changed. A new
  `examples/README.md` provides a "which example should I use?" selector.
