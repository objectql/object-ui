### Major Changes

- bb2ea48: **Phase O.0 — fix: related-list shows wrong records (critical data bug)**

  `RelatedList` previously called `dataSource.find(api)` with no filter
  when auto-fetching, so every Related tab dumped the entire target
  object table instead of the records that actually reference the
  current parent (e.g. an Account showed every Contact in the system,
  not only contacts of that account).

  Two coupled fixes:
  1. `RelatedList` now requires `parentId` + `referenceField` to auto-
     fetch. When both are present it calls `dataSource.find(api,
{ $filter: { [referenceField]: parentId } })`. When either is
     missing it renders the empty state and logs a developer warning —
     never silently fetches the whole object.
  2. `RelatedCountStore` was sending the probe query as `{ where, limit }`
     which most data-source adapters silently ignored (the codebase
     convention is `{ $filter, $top }`). The tab-count badges were
     therefore showing the global object count, not the parent-scoped
     count. Switched to `$filter` / `$top` to match.

  `record:related_list` renderer threads `ctx.recordId` through as
  `parentId`; no schema author changes required.

  **Breaking:** custom callers that depended on `RelatedList` fetching
  the entire object table when `referenceField` is omitted will need to
  either pass `data` explicitly or supply both `parentId` and
  `referenceField`. The previous behaviour was a bug, not a feature.

### Minor Changes

- 8930b15: feat(detail): close the gap between Page-assigned and default record detail pages (Track 1)

  Custom Lightning-style record detail pages (assigned via `assignedPage` /
  `Page` schemas) used to feel meaningfully poorer than the auto-generated
  default detail view. They were missing cross-cutting affordances and
  shipped with English-only tab labels and heavy bordered section cards
  even when the host locale was Chinese. Track 1 closes the visible gap:
  - **app-shell `RecordDetailView`**: the `assignedPage` branch now wears
    the same chrome as the default branch — lifecycle managed-by badge
    and presence avatars in the top-right, `MetadataPanel` debug panel,
    `ActionConfirmDialog` / `ActionParamDialog`, and an auto-appended
    `RecordChatterPanel` at the bottom of the page. Authors opt out of
    the auto-discussion with `assignedPage.disableDiscussion = true`.
  - **plugin-detail `record:details`**: defaults to `inlineEdit: true` so
    fields are click-to-edit just like the default page, and synthesises
    sections with `showBorder: false` by default so a Lightning page
    doesn't double-wrap every block in a heavy Card.
  - **components `page:tabs` / `page:accordion`**: well-known English
    labels (Details / Related / Activity / History / Notes / Files /
    Tasks / Events / Attachments / Chatter / Discussion / Comments /
    Overview / Summary) auto-translate to Chinese (`zh-CN` / `zh-TW`)
    via a built-in dictionary keyed off `document.documentElement.lang`.
    Authors supplying explicit localised labels (string or
    `{ default, zh-CN, ... }`) are not affected.
  - **i18n provider**: applies the initial language to
    `document.documentElement.lang` on mount (i18next does not fire
    `languageChanged` for the bootstrap language), so locale-aware
    renderers downstream see the right value from the first render.

- 95b6b21: feat(page:header): record-aware chip + dedupe registrations (Phase D)

  The `page:header` schema renderer is the visual anchor of every custom
  record detail page (lead, opportunity, future account/contact/case).
  Before this change it had two problems that bled into every custom
  page across the product:
  1. **Quadruple registration**: `@object-ui/layout` registered both
     `page-header` and `page:header`, and `@object-ui/components`
     independently registered `page:header` (and `page:section`).
     Whichever package loaded last won the unqualified `page:header`
     lookup — visually unstable.
  2. **Bare `<h1>`** with no record affordances (no icon, ★ favourite,
     copy-id, edit, ⋯ menu) — every custom page shipped a thinner header
     than the default detail view it was meant to supersede.

  This commit:
  - Removes the `@object-ui/layout` `page:header` registration. The
    layout package keeps the legacy kebab-cased `page-header` alias only.
    The canonical renderer now lives in `@object-ui/components` and is
    always the one resolved.
  - Upgrades `PageHeaderRenderer` to render a `<RecordTitleChip>` when
    wrapped in a `RecordContext`. The chip mirrors the default detail
    header: title (resolved from `data.name` / `data.title` /
    `data.display_name`, or an interpolated `schema.title`), a favourite
    star, the object label, and a copy-record-id button. Authors opt out
    via `recordChrome: false` or hide individual affordances with
    `showStar: false` / `showCopyId: false`.
  - Extracts the chip into a new shared `RecordTitleChip` component in
    `@object-ui/components/custom`. It carries an inline zh-CN/zh-TW
    dictionary for star/copy tooltips so it stays i18n-correct without
    pulling in a translation dependency.
  - Fixes `interpolate()` so a `{account}`-style token that resolves to
    a related-record object renders as empty instead of
    `"[object Object]"`. Authors who want a field of the related record
    should use a deeper path (`{account.name}`).

  Verified at 1440×900 on `lead_detail` and `opportunity_detail`:
  both pages now show the same chip with star + copy-id and the
  opportunity highlights strip looks coherent with the chip above it.

- ddb08a7: feat(page:header,page:tabs): title fallback + single-tab strip auto-hide (Phase G slice 3 polish)
  - `page:header.resolvedTitle` now honors `objectSchema.titleFormat`
    (e.g. `{first_name} {last_name}`) and falls back through `name →
full_name → title → subject → display_name → label` before degrading
    to `${objectLabel} ${idPrefix}`. Mirrors `DetailView.resolveDisplayTitle`
    so default and synthesized record pages produce identical titles.
  - `page:tabs` hides the tab strip entirely when there's only one tab
    (a single labelled pill is visual clutter, not an affordance).
    Authors can opt back in with `properties.alwaysShowStrip: true`.
    Single-tab content margin tightens from `mt-3` to `mt-0` to remove
    the now-empty top space.

- 927187a: Phase N.1 + N.2: visual polish for record detail pages.

  **N.1 — System actions on full Lightning pages.** `PageHeaderRenderer`
  now merges `headerSystemActions` from `RecordContext` with authored
  actions (authored wins on name/id collision), so full custom pages
  (lead, opportunity, ...) once again show 编辑 / 分享 / 删除 alongside
  their authored actions. `sys_share` and `sys_delete` now use the
  `outline` variant instead of `destructive` to read better in
  multi-button clusters.

  **N.2 — Hide empty fields by default in synth detail pages.**
  `record:details` defaults `section.hideEmpty` to `true` so synthesized
  pages don't render label graveyards on first load. The "显示 N 个空字段"
  reveal toggle is preserved as the user-facing escape hatch. Authors can
  opt back into showing every field by setting `hideEmpty: false` on the
  section schema.

- bae8ba8: Phase N.3 + N.4 + N.6: record detail visual polish.

  **N.3 — Highlight strip packs left.** `HeaderHighlight` no longer
  stretches a 1-2 chip strip across the full page. Each cell is now
  `min-w-[8rem] max-w-[16rem]` and wraps via flexbox so sparse strips
  sit naturally at the left edge.

  **N.4 — De-duplicate highlight ↔ body.** `record:details` accepts a
  new `hideFields: string[]` prop. The synth pipeline auto-populates it
  with the highlight-strip field list so a field surfaced in
  `record:highlights` no longer appears a second time in the section
  grid below. Authors can also set it directly on the schema.

  **N.6 — Tab count badges only show when >0.** `page:tabs` suppresses
  the count pill when the count is exactly 0 (was rendering "0" as a
  muted badge on every empty Activity/History tab).

- b14fe09: Phase P.0 + P.5: tighten record-detail header chrome.
  - `RecordTitleChip` collapses the title row to a single baseline-aligned line — H1, eyebrow object label, copy-id, favorite star — instead of the previous two-row title + subtitle layout.
  - `record:details` extends the highlight-field dedup set to also exclude the title field resolved from `objectSchema.primaryField` (or the standard `name`/`full_name`/`title`/`subject`/`display_name`/`label` fallbacks). Removes the duplicate row that previously echoed the H1 (e.g. "客户名称: Acme Corporation") inside the field grid.

- a7bef6e: Phase P.3: anchor `page:tabs` 'line' variant with a proper underline rail.

  The Shadcn Tabs primitive defaults to a pill-card look (bg-muted,
  rounded, white-on-active). On long record-detail pages this strip
  floats unmoored — users scroll past it without realising it's a
  section anchor.

  `PageTabsRenderer` now applies an underline-style treatment to the
  default 'line' variant: the `TabsList` gets a bottom border, and each
  `TabsTrigger` renders as a transparent button with a 2px primary-color
  underline when active. 'card' and 'pill' variants are unchanged.

- 74962b0: feat(detail): record:discussion schema component + flush accordion variant
  - New `record:discussion` schema type lets authors place the record
    chatter feed anywhere in a custom Page schema. Wired through a
    shared `DiscussionContext` provider on the `assignedPage` branch
    of `RecordDetailView`; auto-append still applies when no explicit
    `record:discussion` / `record:chatter` node is present.
  - `page:accordion` gains a `variant` prop. Default `flush` strips the
    per-item border so accordion sections no longer double-wrap inner
    Card-bearing renderers (RelatedList, etc.). Authors who want the
    old visual pass `variant: 'card'`.
  - `translateLabel` now handles compound labels split by `&`, `and`,
    or `和` (e.g. `Notes & Attachments` → `备注与附件`).

- fa4c2cb: feat(detail): renderViaSchema opt-in routes default detail through SchemaRenderer (Track 3 Phase G slice 2)

  When `?renderViaSchema=1` is in the URL, or `objectDef.detail.renderViaSchema === true`,
  `RecordDetailView`'s no-assignedPage branch now synthesizes a canonical
  Page schema (`page:header` → `record:highlights` → `record:path` →
  `page:tabs(record:details)` → `record:discussion`) via
  `buildDefaultPageSchema(objectDef, { sections, highlightFields })` and
  renders it through the existing `<SchemaRenderer>` pipeline.

  This means every object without a custom assigned page can opt in to
  the same chrome (record-aware header chip, chevron path, flush
  accordion, discussion slot) that custom Lightning pages already enjoy.

  Changes:
  - `buildDefaultPageSchema` now emits `page:tabs.items` (correct shape
    for the renderer) rather than `tabs`.
  - `PageHeaderRenderer.resolvedTitle` honors `objectSchema.primaryField`
    before the legacy `name/title/display_name/label` fallbacks.
  - `RecordDetailView` rebuilds the synthesized schema with
    `detailSchema.sections` + `highlightFields` at render time so
    `record:details` inherits the same field layout the legacy
    `<DetailView>` would have produced.

  Flag is intentionally off by default — flipping the default is a
  separate explicit commit after empirical parity validation across
  multiple objects. Known gaps tracked for slice 3: titleFormat
  fallback for objects without `primaryField`, auto Activity / History
  tabs, header-action buttons.

### Patch Changes

- 765d50f: fix(components): strip dangling separators from interpolated record titles

  `page:header` now post-processes the result of interpolating a record's
  `titleFormat` through `cleanupTitleSeparators` so a missing field in the
  template doesn't leave a trailing/leading connector.

  Example: with `titleFormat: '{contract_number} - {name}'` and a contract
  whose `name` is empty, the header was rendering `CTR-0001 -` (with a
  dangling hyphen). It now renders `CTR-0001`. Also handles a missing
  middle field (`A -  - B` → `A - B`) and collapses whitespace runs.

  Supports hyphen / em-dash / en-dash / middle-dot / colon / slash / pipe
  connectors. Idempotent. Exported as `cleanupTitleSeparators` from the
  containers module; covered by 10 new unit tests.

- 3154334: fix(components): render `page:header.actions` on custom detail pages

  `PageHeaderRenderer` previously read `title`, `subtitle`, `breadcrumb`,
  `showStar`, `showCopyId` but never the `actions` array. Authored
  Lightning record pages embed action buttons directly on
  `page:header` (e.g. Lead → "Convert Lead", Opportunity → "Clone
  Opportunity"); these buttons silently disappeared.

  The renderer now reads `schema.actions ?? schema.properties?.actions`,
  filters by `locations.includes('record_header')` (default-include when
  absent), evaluates `visible` / `hidden` predicates (boolean, string,
  or `{ dialect, source }` shapes) against the live record via
  `ExpressionEvaluator`, and dispatches clicks through the
  `ActionProvider`'s shared runner — so `confirmText`, `successMessage`,
  `refreshAfter`, `flow`, navigation and modal handlers all fire.

  The `data-page-actions-slot` portal target is preserved as a fallback
  when no actions are declared in schema.

### Minor Changes

- 3ee436d: feat(components): add `RelatedCountStore` runtime cache + `useRelatedCount`
  hook (built on `useSyncExternalStore`, no new deps). Replaces
  `PageTabsRenderer`'s local per-instance `derivedCounts` state with a
  shared module-scoped store so multiple consumers of the same
  object/parent pair share a single probe.

  Wires `useBulkExecutor` to call `RelatedCountStore.invalidate(resource)`
  after any successful bulk update/delete, so related-list badges on
  parent records re-probe automatically on the next render instead of
  showing stale counts.

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b6afd1: `page:tabs` items now render their optional `icon` (lucide name) and `count`
  badge after the label. Counts >= 1000 are shortened to compact form
  (e.g. `1.2k`). Spec-aligned: `PageTabsItem.icon` and `PageTabsItem.count`.
- aa7855f: `page:tabs` now auto-derives count badges from any descendant `record:related_list`.

  For every tab item whose `count` is not set explicitly, the renderer walks the tab's children (depth-first) to find the first `record:related_list` schema node and issues a `limit:1` find through the active `dataSource` to read the matching `total`. The badge appears in the tab strip without spec authors having to wire counts manually.

  Behavior:
  - Explicit `count` in the spec always wins.
  - Probe is filtered by the parent record id via `relationshipField` when present (skipped until the parent record is loaded).
  - Best-effort: a failed probe just omits the badge — no error surface.
  - Cancellable on unmount.

### Patch Changes

- 170d89f: PageTabsRenderer auto-count now descends into accordion (`properties.items`) and sums counts when a tab contains multiple `record:related_list` widgets — matches Salesforce "Related" tab semantics. Previously only the first list was probed (or none, if wrapped in an accordion).

## 4.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 2bd45af: feat(shell): main becomes the scroll container; record tabs are sticky
  - `AppShell`'s SidebarProvider wrapper is now constrained to viewport
    height (`h-svh overflow-hidden`) instead of expanding with content via
    the default `min-h-svh`. This makes the inner `<main>` (which is
    `overflow-auto`) the actual scroll container instead of the window.
  - `RecordDetailView` page-mode container drops the redundant
    `h-full overflow-auto` (avoids nested scrollers; main owns scroll now).
  - `page:tabs` (horizontal) gets `sticky top-0 z-20` with a translucent
    backdrop so the tab strip stays visible while users scroll through
    long record pages — the Salesforce Lightning behaviour our schemas
    were already implying.

### Patch Changes

- 6b683c8: fix(detail): clean up record page rendering
  - Drop `ai:chat_window` from the protocol-component placeholder list. The
    floating chat overlay (plugin-chatbot) is the canonical AI entry point;
    inline page schemas that still reference `ai:chat_window` now surface
    as an explicit "Unknown component type" so the misconfiguration is
    fixed at the source instead of silently leaking a placeholder card.
  - `page:header` now resolves `{field.path}` tokens in `title` / `description`
    against the current record context (matching the behaviour of the
    alternative `containers.tsx` renderer). Without this, schemas like
    `title: "{first_name} {last_name}"` rendered the literal template.
  - `containers.tsx` `PageHeaderRenderer`: also read from `schema.properties.*`
    as a fallback so both inlined and raw-bag schema shapes are supported.

## 4.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 4e7bc1b: **Report editor panel overhaul**

  The report configuration panel is now safe to open on any spec-shape `Report` and only exposes fields that are actually persisted by `@objectstack/spec`.

  `@object-ui/plugin-report`:
  - Add a bidirectional `SpecFilterAdapter` so `ReportConfigPanel` can edit
    spec `FilterCondition` filters (`{field: value}`, `{field: {$op: value}}`,
    top-level `$and`/`$or`). Complex / nested filters fall back to a
    read-only banner and are preserved verbatim on save.
  - Drop sections that never round-tripped through the spec
    (`conditionalFormatting`, `sections`, `export`, `schedule`, `appearance`)
    and their helper components.
  - Add type-driven section visibility: `tabular` shows Columns/Filters,
    `summary` adds Rows + Chart, `matrix` adds Rows + Columns axis + Chart.
  - New `GroupingsBuilder` covers `groupingsDown`/`groupingsAcross` with
    `sortOrder` and date-aware `dateGranularity` controls.
  - New `ColumnsEditor` lets users reorder picked columns, override labels,
    set aggregates and choose a display format.
  - Chart subset now mirrors the spec: chart `title`, `showLegend`,
    `showDataLabels`, plus `funnel` (scatter removed).
  - Validation banner highlights missing `objectName` and missing
    rows/columns for `matrix`/`summary` reports.
  - All editor labels and hints are i18n-driven (`report.editor.*`).
  - 18 new unit tests cover the filter adapter round-trip.

  `@object-ui/components`:
  - `FilterBuilder` now guards against malformed external `value` props.
    Previously a spec-shape filter (`{is_active: true}`) would crash the
    component on first render; the builder now falls back to an empty
    AND group whenever `value` is not a valid `FilterGroup`.

  `@object-ui/i18n`:
  - Add `report.editor.*` strings to `en` and `zh`.

- 8442c05: Improve report editor panel usability based on real-user browser testing:
  - **Wider config panel** — the report editor now defaults to a `--config-panel-width`
    of 440px (up from 280px), driven by a new optional `style` prop on
    `ConfigPanelRenderer`. Long field labels, report titles, type labels, and filter
    rows no longer truncate to "Account Na" / "kup" / "ct" / 1-character widths.
  - **Disambiguated "Columns" sections** — for `summary` and `matrix` reports the
    measure list is now labelled **"Values / 度量"** (pivot-style vocabulary) instead
    of "Columns", which previously clashed with the matrix's pivot column axis
    (also called "Columns / 列"). The two sections used to be indistinguishable.
    New i18n key `report.editor.values` / `valuesHint` is shipped for all 10
    locales (en, zh, ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru).
  - **Reordered sections for matrix/summary** — the editor now surfaces _Rows_
    and _Columns_ (the pivot axes) **before** _Values_, mirroring how a business
    user thinks about a pivot table.
  - **Per-row aggregate/format headers** — each column row in `ColumnsEditor` now
    shows small "Aggregate" / "Format" labels above the respective selects, and
    the row uses a 2-line layout so the label input has its own line. The cramped
    3-dropdowns-side-by-side layout at 10px font is gone.
  - **Searchable field picker** — the "Add columns" list now has a search box,
    a `filtered / total` counter, an empty-state message, and a scrollable bordered
    container. New i18n keys: `report.editor.searchFields`,
    `report.editor.noMatchingFields`.

## 4.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 7c9b85c: Fix compatibility with the framework's normalized Expression envelope format.

  `@objectstack/spec` now emits predicate (`visible` / `enabled`) and template
  (`titleFormat`) fields as `{ dialect, source }` envelopes instead of bare
  strings. The previous implementation assumed strings and crashed the record
  detail view (`TypeError: titleFormat.replace is not a function`) and printed
  `Failed to evaluate expression: ${[object Object]}` for every action visibility
  predicate.
  - `@object-ui/core`: `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate` / `evaluateCondition` now
    unwrap Expression envelopes transparently.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `toPredicateInput()` helper to safely normalize
    `boolean | string | Expression` predicate inputs into the `${expr}` form
    expected by `useCondition`.
  - `@object-ui/components`: `action-bar`, `action-button`, `action-group`,
    `action-icon`, `action-menu` renderers use `toPredicateInput()` instead of
    template-literal interpolation that produced `${[object Object]}`.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`, `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`,
    `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/app-shell`,
    `@object-ui/console`: title-format helpers accept both legacy strings and
    the new `{ source }` envelope.

  All changes are backward-compatible — legacy bare strings continue to work.

## 4.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 925051d: fix: convert Tailwind v3 `[--var]` arbitrary value syntax to v4 `(--var)`

  Shadcn `Sidebar`, `Calendar`, `Chart`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `HoverCard`,
  `Menubar`, `Select`, `Dropdown`, `Context-Menu`, and `AppSidebar` used the
  Tailwind v3 syntax `w-[--sidebar-width]`, `origin-[--radix-...]`, etc.
  Tailwind v4 no longer interprets the bare `--xxx` inside arbitrary values
  as `var(--xxx)`, so the rule emits empty CSS — the sidebar collapses to
  0 width and overlays the main content, dropdown/popover positions fall
  back to the wrong origin, and the calendar cells lose their fixed size.

  Replaced all such occurrences with the v4 CSS-variable shorthand
  `w-(--sidebar-width)`, `origin-(--radix-...)`, etc. Existing
  `[calc(var(--xxx)*-1)]` arbitrary expressions are unaffected.

- 1b6dc64: fix: complete Tailwind v3→v4 migration cleanup
  - Rename deprecated `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0` and `flex-grow-N` →
    `grow-N` (Tailwind v4 dropped the long-form aliases). Affects
    data-table, fields/index, FileField, ChatbotEnhanced,
    FloatingChatbotPanel, ProcessDesigner, HistoryPanel, KanbanEnhanced,
    KanbanImpl, plugin-timeline index, FlowDesigner, LayoutRenderer.
  - Replace `theme(spacing.4)` inside arbitrary-value `[calc(...)]` with
    literal `1rem` in sidebar.tsx — `theme()` is deprecated in v4.
  - Remove obsolete v3-escape CSS overrides from index.css and
    sidebar-fixes.css. The component source now uses native v4 stacked
    data variants (`group-data-[state=collapsed]:group-data-[collapsible=icon]:w-(--sidebar-width-icon)`)
    which Tailwind v4 emits correctly without the manual overrides.
    Only the bespoke `.sidebar-menu-button-icon-mode*` rules are kept.

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:
  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

### Minor Changes

- f1ca238: Async streaming export — spec v4 export job lifecycle end-to-end

  For tenants with millions of records the legacy in-memory CSV/JSON export blew
  past the browser's heap. This change wires the spec v4 streaming-export
  contract through the renderer end-to-end:

  **`@object-ui/types`** — `DataSource` gains four optional methods:
  - `createExportJob(resource, request)` → `{ jobId, status, estimatedRecords, createdAt }`
  - `getExportJobProgress(jobId)` → `{ status, processedRecords, totalRecords, percentComplete, downloadUrl, … }`
  - `cancelExportJob(jobId)` (optional)
  - `getExportJobDownloadUrl(jobId)` (optional — for short-lived signed URLs)

  Mirror the spec v4 `CreateExportJobRequest` / `ExportJobProgress` shapes; types
  remain dependency-free.

  **`@object-ui/components`** — new public API:
  - `useExportJob({ dataSource, pollIntervalMs, onComplete, onError })` — owns the
    full polling loop, terminal-state handling, cancel, and download.
  - `<ExportProgressDialog open onOpenChange job filename closeAfterDownloadMs />` —
    determinate or indeterminate progress bar, byte/record counts, Cancel while
    running, Download on completion, error banner on failure.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-grid`** — `ObjectGrid` now auto-detects async export
  support: when the `DataSource` exposes `createExportJob` + `getExportJobProgress`
  (and the schema isn't using inline `value` data) the export popover routes
  through the streaming path with a progress dialog. Otherwise it falls back to
  the existing client-side blob path. Set `exportOptions.streaming = false` to
  force the legacy path.

### Patch Changes

- a2d7023: End-user feature batch — forms, designer history, import/export, and PWA offline sync.

  **Forms (`@object-ui/fields`, `@object-ui/providers`)**
  - `FileField`: native `<input capture="environment">` camera capture for mobile devices, plus a uploading-progress indicator driven by `UploadProvider`.
  - `ImageField`: per-image inline crop/rotate via the lazy-loaded `ImageCropperDialog` (canvas-based, zero new deps).
  - New `UploadProvider` in `@object-ui/providers` with pluggable adapters for S3 and Azure Blob (plus the default object-URL adapter for local previews). XHR-based with progress, abort, and retry.
  - `LookupField`: `lookup.dependsOn: string | string[]` to chain dependent lookups (e.g. State depends on Country); the trigger is gated until parent values are present and the OData `$filter` is built automatically.

  **Container-aware widget widths (`@object-ui/components`)**
  - New `useResizeObserver(ref)` hook exposing `{ width, height }` of any element. SSR-safe; reads the initial size via `getBoundingClientRect`.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-kanban` now react to their container size instead of `window.innerWidth`, so they behave correctly inside split panels and dashboards.

  **Designer history (`@object-ui/plugin-designer`)**
  - `useUndoRedo` (and therefore `useDesignerHistory`) gains `persistKey` + `storage` options to round-trip the undo/redo stack through `sessionStorage`, plus a `clearPersisted()` cleanup helper. Drafts now survive accidental tab refreshes.
  - New `<HistoryPanel>` component renders the timeline visually with one-click jump-to-checkpoint via the new `jumpTo(index)` API.

  **Import wizard (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**
  - Saved column-mapping templates: name, save, re-apply, and delete via a new template bar in the mapping step. Persisted under `objectui:import-templates:${objectName}` (override via `templateStorageKey` / `templateStorage`).
  - Inline validation correction: cells with errors in the preview step are now editable; corrections feed straight into the import without requiring a re-upload, with green-bar status indicators for fixed rows.

  **PWA offline sync (`@object-ui/mobile`)**
  - New `MemoryOfflineQueue` / `IndexedDbOfflineQueue` (`createOfflineQueue()` picks the best backend) backed by IndexedDB.
  - `createOfflineDataSource(inner, { queue })` wraps any DataSource so mutations issued while offline (or that fail with a network-style error) are queued and replayed in order on reconnect. Includes `replay()`, `drop()`, `clear()`, `pending()`, an `onChange` notifier, and an opt-in `resolveConflict` hook for stale-write conflicts.
  - New `useOfflineSync(source)` hook exposes `{ isOnline, pending, isReplaying, replay, drop, clear }` and auto-replays on the browser's `online` event.
  - `getServiceWorkerSource(opts)` emits a customisable Service Worker that pre-caches the app shell, applies network-first to API requests, and broadcasts `REPLAY_QUEUE` to clients on Background Sync. `requestBackgroundSync(tag)` registers a one-shot sync from the page.

- de881ef: Mobile UX round 3 — Form: sticky save bar, fullscreen long-text editor, and auto-stepper for long forms on small viewports.

  **`@object-ui/types`** — `ObjectFormSchema.mobile` (new) lets a single form opt into all three behaviours:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'object-form',
    objectName: 'leads',
    mode: 'create',
    mobile: {
      stickyActions: true,        // pin Submit/Cancel to bottom on phones
      stepper: 'auto',            // long forms render one field per step
      stepperMinFields: 8,        // …but only past this many fields
      stepperFieldsPerStep: 1,    // … (default 1)
      fullscreenLongText: true,   // textarea fields get an "expand" affordance
    },
  }
  ```

  `FormSchema.mobileStickyActions` (new) is the lower-level escape hatch — applied automatically when `mobile.stickyActions` is set on `ObjectFormSchema`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-form`** — `ObjectForm` now:
  - propagates `mobile.fullscreenLongText` to every textarea/markdown/html field as `mobile_fullscreen: true`,
  - sets `mobileStickyActions` on the inner form schema and adds `pb-20` padding so content isn't covered by the fixed bar,
  - when `mobile.stepper === true` (or `'auto'` + `useIsMobile()` + > `stepperMinFields` fields), routes the flat field list through the existing `WizardForm` with synthetic single-field "steps" — keeping per-step validation and the existing `Next`/`Back`/`Submit` flow.

  **`@object-ui/components`** — the registered `form` renderer adds:
  - a `mobileStickyActions` opt-in that turns the action row into a `position: sticky; bottom: 0` bar on small viewports, and
  - an inline `FullscreenTextarea` wrapper used when no field-package widget is registered, providing the same expand-button + edit-dialog UX so the feature works even in lighter setups.

  **`@object-ui/fields`** — `TextAreaField` ships the actual fullscreen UX: a top-right `Maximize2` button opens a near-fullscreen `Dialog` containing a full-height `Textarea` with a draft-then-commit save model (Cancel reverts).

  All three behaviours are off by default — existing forms render unchanged.

- b429568: chore(examples): relocate console templates under `examples/`

  The fork-ready ObjectStack console template moved from `apps/console-starter`
  to `examples/console-starter`, so `apps/` only contains real deployable
  products (`console`, `site`). The third-party integration demo
  `examples/minimal-console` was renamed to `examples/byo-backend-console`
  to make its "bring-your-own backend" purpose explicit and to remove the
  naming collision with the starter template. Source comments and READMEs in
  `@object-ui/app-shell` and `@object-ui/components` have been updated to
  point at the new paths; no runtime behaviour changed. A new
  `examples/README.md` provides a "which example should I use?" selector.
