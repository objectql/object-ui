### Patch Changes

- ebb4e0e: The date formatter's last three en-US channels now follow the display locale
  (objectui#4272).

  objectui#4468 (PR #4512) pointed every date _renderer_ at `useDisplayLocale()`.
  Three channels were out of its reach because they are properties of the
  formatter's signature and of its callers rather than of any renderer, so a `zh`
  console still met English dates in three places:

  - **`formatDate`'s `'short'` branch** hardcoded
    `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short' })`, so it rendered an English
    month even when the caller had threaded `options.locale` into that very call.
    Its only consumers are ObjectGrid's two mobile-card date cells, which threaded
    no locale — fixing either half alone moves nothing, so both land here.
  - **`formatDateTime` took no options parameter at all**, so no caller could
    localize it however hard it tried; it always handed `Intl` an `undefined` tag,
    which means the MACHINE's locale — neither of the repo's two locale channels.
    The parameter is optional and lands together with its consumers, plugin-gantt's
    four tooltip call sites.
  - **The lookup picker's MongoDB `$date` fallback** called a bare
    `toLocaleDateString()` with no tag.

  One resolver everywhere, as before: `useDisplayLocale()` (tenant regional
  default → active UI language → `'en'`). `Intl` accepts `'zh'` verbatim, so there
  is still no mapping table anywhere.

  English output is byte-identical at every touched site — `en` and `en-US` agree
  on all twelve short month names — and the `'short'` layout itself is unchanged:
  only the month token is localized, the compact `"Jan 15, '24"` shape around it
  is a deliberate fixed layout for narrow cards.

  `@object-ui/fields` is `minor` because `formatDateTime`'s new optional parameter
  is visible in the package's entry `.d.ts`; the plugin packages' own `.d.ts` files
  are byte-identical, so their change is module-local.

- 828549a: The gantt's conflict dialog shows the number of affected tasks again, not a literal `{2}`

  `gantt.conflict.body` was resolved at the render site with a literal string replace on **single** braces — `t('gantt.conflict.body').replace('{count}', String(n))` — while all ten locale packs spell the placeholder the i18next way, `{{count}}`. `"…{{count}}…".replace("{count}", "2")` consumes the inner seven characters and leaves the outer pair behind, so every user on every loaded pack read "自动重新排程 **{2}** 个受影响的任务？". The dialog now interpolates through i18next (`t('gantt.conflict.body', { count })`), the idiom `gantt.delete.body` already used.

  The two sibling keys three lines away in the same file, `gantt.autoScheduleDlg.body` and `.skipped`, were **not** broken — pack and call site both used single braces, and they rendered correctly. They are converted anyway, because that split is the whole mechanism: two write-confirmation dialogs in one component carried two different interpolation idioms, so `conflict.body` drifting to the i18next spelling in the packs (which is the correct spelling, and matches every other placeholder in the bundle) silently broke the render. Leaving the auto-schedule keys on the literal-replace idiom leaves the same trap armed for the next translator. All ten packs and the plugin's bundled English fallback table now agree on `{{count}}` for all three; only the braces moved, no translation was reworded.

  `gantt.quickFilter.resultSummary` stays deliberately single-brace — its `ObjectGantt` call site really does resolve `{shown}`/`{total}` with a literal replace, and that convention is pinned by its own parity test. It is now the only key in the gantt namespace on that idiom, and the comments at both spellings say so.

  Nothing caught this, and each gate was silent for its own reason: the cross-pack parity check compares en against each pack, and all eleven spellings agreed; the en-drift check compares a pack against its own history, and the packs were born matching. Both are **relative** comparisons, and the defect lived in the **absolute** relationship between a pack's spelling and the syntax the call site resolves. The existing render test asserted the dialog body contains `'1'` — which `{1}` satisfies. The new pin asserts the absolute form directly, under a real loaded pack, for every way a placeholder can survive to the screen.

- e1ade8f: An illegal gantt dependency link now says why it was refused, instead of doing nothing

  Dragging a dependency onto a target the gantt refuses — itself, a locked row, a group row, or one that would close a dependency cycle — produced no feedback of any kind: no toast, no dialog, no cursor change, no target outline, not even a console warning. The guard was right and completely invisible, so a user drawing a legitimate-looking dependency got a dead interaction and no way to learn the constraint. The rejection was silent in both places it could have shown: a refused bar never became the drop target, so it got no hover treatment at all, and the release handler only ran its body when a target _had_ been registered, so the drop itself was a no-op.

  Both halves are now wired, and both read the **same** verdict. `canReceiveLink`'s four-branch boolean became `classifyLinkTarget`, which returns which branch refused (or `null`), with the boolean derived from it. The hover affordance and the drop toast are two consumers of that one classification, so the reason a user is shown cannot drift from the reason the link was actually refused — there is no second classifier to disagree. The branch names are the leaves of the new `gantt.link.rejected.*` keys, so a branch added later without a message surfaces as a missing key rather than as a plausible-but-wrong sentence.

  During the drag, a refused bar under the pointer gets `cursor: not-allowed` and a destructive outline; on release it raises a toast naming the reason. Four messages, one per branch, in all ten packs. Both the cursor and the outline are driven from inline `style` rather than utility classes, matching the bar's existing read-only cursor three lines away and for the same reason recorded there: `cursor-not-allowed` and the ring alpha utilities are not emitted in the prebuilt components CSS, so a class would look correct in a DOM test and render nothing in a browser.

  Deliberately unchanged: a host veto through `onBeforeDependencyCreate` stays silent. That rejection carries a reason only the host knows, and the gantt has none to show — surfacing it means exposing a rejection-reason output on the public component, which is a separate contract rather than a rider on this one. The four built-in reasons are the gantt's own policy and are the only ones it can explain.

  One of the four, `group`, has no end-to-end path today: a `type: 'group'` row renders no bar, so the drag can never target it. The message is kept anyway — without it the branch would render a raw key on screen if it ever did fire — and the test pins the reachability fact, so it goes red the day group rows gain a bar. Filed as objectui#4209.

- db4ad6b: Gantt tooltip currency re-formats when the tenant currency resolves
  (objectui#4542).

  ObjectGantt's `tasks` memo builds every tooltip string eagerly inside its
  callback, and the `'currency'` case resolves its code down to the tenant
  default (`resolveFieldCurrency(def, tenantCurrency)`). `tenantCurrency` was
  not in the memo's dependency array, so the value was read but never watched.

  That default comes from `GET /api/v1/auth/me/localization`, which is cosmetic
  and non-blocking and therefore answers AFTER first paint. The context change
  re-rendered ObjectGantt, but with none of `data` / `ganttConfig` /
  `objectSchema` / `displayLocale` changed the memo handed back its cached task
  array — so a tooltip amount kept the pre-resolution rendering (a plain
  `1,234.50` instead of `€1,234.50`) until something unrelated invalidated the
  memo.

  This is the currency twin of objectui#4272, which added `displayLocale` to
  this same array for the same reason, and it is not covered by that dep: the
  producer writes currency and locale from one response, so a tenant that
  configures BOTH re-runs the memo through the locale channel — but a tenant
  that configures a currency and no locale (the common shape, since the tenant
  locale is frequently unset) leaves `displayLocale` untouched and the currency
  stale.

  Module-local: the fix is one dependency, the package's `.d.ts` files are
  byte-identical, and rendering is unchanged whenever the channel resolves
  before first paint or a field carries its own currency code.

- a908882: Gantt tooltip numbers and currency follow the display locale (objectui#4553).

  `formatFieldValue`, the tooltip value formatter inside ObjectGantt's `tasks`
  memo, had its four TEMPORAL call sites threaded with `useDisplayLocale()` by
  objectui#4272. The numeric cases beside them passed no locale, so they reached
  `new Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, …)` — the MACHINE's locale, which is neither
  of the repo's two locale channels.

  One tooltip therefore rendered two conventions. A German session read
  `5. Jan. 2024` on the date row and `1,234.50` on the amount row directly below
  it, where German groups with `.` and marks the decimal with `,`. Inverted
  separators do not read as an unstyled number; they read as a different number.
  The currency row was affected in the symbol's POSITION too — `1.234,50 EUR`
  rather than `EUR1,234.50` — while the currency CODE itself was already resolved
  correctly (objectui#4542 made the memo watch it); only the locale rendering that
  code was missing.

  `number` / `integer` / `float` / `decimal` and `currency` now pass the
  `displayLocale` already read at component level, using each formatter's existing
  locale parameter. No formatter signature changed and no memo dependency changed
  (`displayLocale` has been in that array since objectui#4272), so this is
  consumer-side threading only: the package's `.d.ts` files are byte-identical and
  English output is unchanged at every touched site.

  Known gap, tracked on objectui#4553: the `percent` row still does not follow the
  display locale. `formatPercent(value, precision)` takes no locale parameter —
  it is `${percentDisplayValue(value).toFixed(precision)}%`, so it builds no
  `Intl.NumberFormat` at all and renders in NO locale rather than the machine's
  (ASCII decimal mark, never grouped, identical on every machine). Closing that
  needs a `@object-ui/fields` signature change, which is outside this change's
  ruled surface, and is pinned by a test here so the gap cannot drift unnoticed.

- 0ca6096: A gantt task titled `A$&B` no longer prints `{{title}}` back into its own delete dialog — the two hand-rolled provider-less fallback interpolators are literal, like i18next

  objectui#3418 fixed the shared helper's fallback interpolator: `String.prototype.replace` became `split(needle).join(value)`, because `replace` and `replaceAll` both interpret `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$$` in the **replacement** string and i18next does not. Two hand-rolled copies of that interpolator never got the fix. Both are deliberate non-users of `createSafeTranslation` — each falls back per key so a host dictionary that covers the common keys but lags on newer ones still resolves what it has — so the shared fix had no path to reach them.

  The reachable one is gantt's. `gantt.delete.body` is `'"{{title}}" will be permanently removed. …'` and its call site interpolates the record's own title, which is user data:

  | task title | rendered before                                                       | rendered now                              |
  | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | `A$&B`     | `"A{{title}}B" will be permanently removed.`                          | `"A$&B" will be permanently removed.`     |
  | `` x$`y `` | `"x"y" will be permanently removed.`                                  | `` "x$`y" will be permanently removed. `` |
  | `p$$q`     | `"p$q" will be permanently removed.`                                  | `"p$$q" will be permanently removed.`     |
  | `u$'v`     | `"u" will be permanently removed. …v" will be permanently removed. …` | `"u$'v" will be permanently removed.`     |

  The first row is the ugly one: `$&` expands to the matched text, so the placeholder itself is printed back to the user inside the record's own name. Gantt's copy also carried the other half of the same defect — a bare string needle substitutes only the **first** occurrence, where i18next substitutes every one — and `split`/`join` fixes both at once.

  The import wizard's copy used a `g`-flagged `RegExp`, which covered the repeated-placeholder half but could not touch the `$`-pattern half: that harm lives in the replacement string, not the needle. Its values are authored metadata — field labels and type names spliced into `grid.import.missingRequiredHint` and `grid.import.legacyReferenceBlocked` — so a label containing `$&` corrupted the hint the same way. Retiring the `RegExp` also retires an unescaped needle, since the placeholder name went into the pattern uninterpolated; that was inert while every placeholder name is a bare identifier, and is now structurally impossible.

  This is the provider-less path only (standalone embedding, unit tests). With an `I18nProvider` mounted, i18next serves these keys and was already literal on both sides — which is exactly why the divergence was invisible. No pack, key or call site changed; the three `{{count}}` gantt keys take numbers and were never affected, and `gantt.quickFilter.resultSummary`'s deliberate single-brace idiom is resolved by its call site rather than this interpolator and is untouched.

- 36310dc: `formatPercent` groups its output and follows the display locale — the last
  tooltip/cell channel (objectui#4553).

  PR #4557 threaded the gantt tooltip's number and currency rows and measured that
  the percent row could not follow: `formatPercent(value, precision)` took no
  locale parameter, and its whole body was
  `${percentDisplayValue(value).toFixed(precision)}%`. It built no
  `Intl.NumberFormat` and never reached `formatDisplayNumber` — so unlike its
  siblings it did not render in the MACHINE's locale, it rendered in **no** locale:
  an ASCII decimal mark, never a grouping separator, byte-identical on every
  machine.

  **English output MOVES, and that is the fix.** Because the function never
  grouped, `1235%` was wrong in en-US too, not only in German. Grouping and locale
  therefore land together:

  |            | before  | after          |
  | ---------- | ------- | -------------- |
  | en, 1234.5 | `1235%` | `1,235%`       |
  | de, 1234.5 | `1235%` | `1.235\u00a0%` |
  | de, 80     | `80%`   | `80\u00a0%`    |

  Values below the grouping threshold are unchanged in English (`80%`, `12.5%`,
  `33.33%`), so the move is confined to four digits and up. German changes at every
  magnitude, because the no-break space before the sign is part of the locale's
  percent convention — which is what routing through `Intl` buys over appending a
  literal `%`.

  The scaling contract is untouched: `percentDisplayValue` still disambiguates a
  fraction-stored percent (`0.8` → 80%) from a whole one, so the list cell and the
  dashboard measure formatter still agree.

  Consumers are threaded in the same change, the parameter never landing
  speculatively:

  - **fields** — `PercentCellRenderer`, on BOTH of its paths. Its whole-percent
    branch (`progress` / `completion` fields, which store 0-100 and must skip the
    fraction scaling) was a second bare `toFixed` call; leaving it behind would
    have made one grid internally inconsistent, so both branches now share one
    locale-aware body and differ only in the scaling policy.
  - **plugin-gantt** — the tooltip percent row, completing objectui#4553's switch.
  - **plugin-grid** — the mobile card's percent cell, which sits in the same
    density row as a date cell objectui#4272 had already localized.
  - **plugin-dashboard** — `renderFieldValue`'s percent branch. It is a plain
    function rather than a component, so it takes the locale as an optional fourth
    parameter beside the `tenantCurrency` already threaded that way, and both of
    its callers pass it and declare it in their memo dependency arrays.

  Bumps follow each package's own `.d.ts` diff, measured in both directions.
  `@object-ui/fields` and `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` are `minor` on the
  objectui#4272 / PR #4544 precedent — quoted from that changeset: "`@object-ui/fields`
  is `minor` because `formatDateTime`'s new optional parameter is visible in the
  package's entry `.d.ts`; the plugin packages' own `.d.ts` files are
  byte-identical, so their change is module-local." Here `formatPercent` and
  `renderFieldValue` each gain an entry-visible optional parameter, while
  plugin-gantt's and plugin-grid's `.d.ts` files are byte-identical and stay
  `patch`.

### Patch Changes

- 022002a: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches the remaining object-bound public
  blocks: `object-gantt` / `object-timeline` / `object-map` / `object-pivot` /
  `object-master-detail-form` / `embeddable-form` / `record:line_items`
  (objectstack#7121).

  objectstack#6953 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to the eight blocks it
  named and left the same declaration inert on these seven. Each gates its fetch on
  its own object key and nothing mapped `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page
  written the way the spec documents rendered an empty gantt / an empty timeline
  rail / a map with no markers / an empty cross-tab / a field-less form — with no
  request and no diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
  objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged, through the
  shared `ElementDataSourceGate` (no change to it or to the resolution layer): a
  named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error on every one of
  these blocks instead of degrading to the object's full scope.

  Each block maps **only** the keys it genuinely reads, which for this batch means
  several keys stay deliberately unmapped rather than being parked somewhere
  plausible:

  - `object-gantt` and `object-map` take `object` / `filter` / `sort`; neither has a
    row cap or a field-list read site.
  - `object-pivot` takes `object` / `filter`; a cross-tab orders itself by its own
    row/column grouping and cannot be computed over a truncated page.
  - `object-timeline` takes `object` only — its fetch is
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`, with no filter/sort read site
    at all, so a named view is error-checked and then contributes nothing.
  - `embeddable-form` and `object-master-detail-form` take `object` only (the
    parent object, in the master-detail case); a form that writes one record has no
    collection query for `filter` / `sort` / `limit` to narrow.
  - `record:line_items` takes `object` onto **`childObject`** — the collection it
    actually lists — and nothing else: its query is the parent FK plus a fixed
    `$top: 500`, and its `columns` are editable `GridColumn` objects rather than a
    field-name projection a view could supply.

  The per-block coverage table, including every residual gap named above, is in
  `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour change for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

- 6d762da: The five locale keys behind #3546's eight no-fallback `t()` call sites are now defined in all ten packs, so the built-in-view toasts, the activity-timeline source link, the wizard's required-field toast and the Gantt refresh button's accessible name are translated instead of falling back to English — or, on two surfaces, to the key itself (part of #3546).

  `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` measured 258 keys that a `t()` call site asks for and no pack defines. These five were the subset with no working inline default: `console.objectView.cannotEditMetaView`, `console.objectView.cannotDeleteMetaView`, `detail.viewSource`, `gantt.toolbar.refresh` and `wizard.missingRequired`. Adding a `defaultValue` is deliberately not the fix — that mechanism is what kept all 258 invisible for months.

  **Two of the eight sites really did render the raw key**, and both go through a binding with nothing in front of i18next. `ObjectView.tsx` calls `useObjectTranslation()` directly, so five toasts read `console.objectView.cannotEditMetaView` / `cannotDeleteMetaView` on screen; the `|| 'Built-in views cannot be renamed.'` guards next to them were dead on every path, because i18next answers a miss with the key itself and a non-empty string never falls through `||`. Those four unreachable English strings are removed rather than repaired: one key served four call sites (rename / pin / set-as-default / configure), so the pack copy covers any change to a built-in view instead of naming one operation. `RecordActivityTimeline.tsx` fails the same way for a subtler reason — `useDetailTranslation` is `createSafeTranslation(..., 'detail.back')`, and because `detail.back` does resolve, the probe hands back i18next's `t` for every key and bypasses the defaults map wholesale, so `detail.viewSource` reached the user verbatim.

  **The other two sites were not rendering a raw key**, contrary to the issue's description, and are fixed here as the milder "English in all ten languages" class. `wizard.missingRequired` is its own hook's probe key, so the probe failed and `createSafeTranslation` correctly served its English default. `gantt.toolbar.refresh` goes through `useGanttTranslation`, which deliberately does not use `createSafeTranslation` and falls back per key — so the refresh button's `aria-label` was "Refresh", in English, never the key. Screen-reader users heard an English word rather than an identifier; a `zh` session now hears 刷新.

  Regression cover is provider-mounted on purpose: with no `I18nProvider` the defaults maps answer every one of these keys and the assertions pass while the console is broken, which is precisely the false-green the issue documents. For the two sites whose English output was already correct, `en` cannot discriminate before from after — the `zh` assertions are the ones that pin the fix.

## 17.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 5c856ec: `ObjectGantt`'s quick-filter bar is now localized instead of pinned to Chinese. The four `QuickFilterBar` labels (`all`, `clear`, `empty`, `resultSummary`) were hardcoded as Chinese string literals at the `ObjectGantt` call site, so the bar read 全部 / 清除筛选 / 无可选项 / 显示 N / M 项任务 under an `en`, `ja`, `es` or `ar` session while the rest of the gantt toolbar localized correctly — a conspicuous mismatch, and a violation of the English-only-codebase rule. `QuickFilterBar` itself was never at fault: it is presentational and already falls back to English, so the host was the only thing pinning the copy.

  The four strings moved into a new `gantt.quickFilter` namespace, added to all ten built-in locale packs, and the call site now resolves them through the gantt package's existing `useGanttTranslation` — the same per-key hook every other gantt string already uses, so a host dictionary that lags on these keys still renders the bundled English default rather than a raw key. `gantt.quickFilter.resultSummary` deliberately keeps SINGLE-brace placeholders (`{shown}` / `{total}`): the call site substitutes them with a literal `.replace`, not i18next interpolation, matching `gantt.autoScheduleDlg.body` and the placeholder convention `all-locales-key-parity` already recognises. Anyone retranslating these packs must keep that spelling — a respell to `{{shown}}` would render the raw placeholder to the user.

### Patch Changes

- 7d46648: fix(hooks): stop calling translation hooks inside try/catch (objectui#2879)

  Eleven call sites wrapped a React hook in `try`/`catch` to make it
  "provider-safe". `useObjectTranslation` and `useObjectLabel` already are — they
  read context optionally and fall back to react-i18next's global instance, and
  never throw. The `catch` bought nothing and cost correctness: a throw _after_
  the hook ran desyncs hook order on the next render, because React matches hooks
  positionally. objectui#2595/#2596 fixed exactly this in `@object-ui/i18n`'s
  `createSafeTranslation`; nine plugin-local re-implementations kept their own
  copy of the bug, and two more (`ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectView`) were found by the
  new lint rule below — `ObjectView` had even suppressed
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` inline to keep it.

  - Six exact re-implementations now delegate to `createSafeTranslation`:
    `plugin-detail`, `plugin-timeline`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-calendar`,
    `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid`, `plugin-designer`.
  - `components`' `data-table` also delegates; `createSafeTranslation` now
    returns `language` alongside `t` so consumers that localize dates don't need
    a second hook call. Purely additive.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-grid`'s `ImportWizard` keep their local hooks —
    they fall back _per key_, which a single-probe factory cannot express and
    which their comments justify (a host dictionary that covers common keys but
    lags on newer ones). Only the `try`/`catch` is removed.
  - `ObjectTimeline` and `ObjectView` call the hook directly and probe the
    returned value, mirroring `useSafeFieldLabel`.

  Adds `object-ui/no-try-catch-around-hook` (error) so a twelfth copy fails CI.
  It only matches `use*` names, accepts member calls solely on `React` (so
  `vi.useRealTimers()` is not a hook), and resets its try-depth inside nested
  functions (so `renderHook(() => useThing())` inside a `try` is fine) — both
  false positives were real code in this repo and are pinned in the rule's tests.

  `eslint-rules/**/*.test.js` matched no vitest project glob, so the local
  plugin's specs had never run in CI. They are now included; all three pass.

  `ObjectTimeline`'s test mock of `@object-ui/react` omitted `useObjectLabel` —
  the removed `try`/`catch` had been silently absorbing that gap. The mock is now
  complete.

## 16.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 7cf4051: chore(deps): align every `@objectstack/*` dependency to `^16.0.0-rc.0`

  Bumps `@objectstack/spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` from `^15.1.1` to the
  `16.0.0-rc.0` pre-release across the workspace (root + `apps/console` +
  `apps/site` + all consuming packages). ObjectUI's own packages are already on
  major 16, so this closes the 15↔16 skew between ObjectUI and the `@objectstack`
  contract libraries (which publish in lockstep with `spec`).

  This is a dependency alignment, not a behavioral migration: the full workspace
  build (43/43) and the `@objectstack`-consuming package test suites
  (`core` / `app-shell` / `data-objectstack` / `plugin-form` / `types`) are green
  against `16.0.0-rc.0` with no source changes required.

  Practical effect: `@objectstack/client@16.0.0-rc.0` now ships
  `data.batchTransaction` (framework #3271), so `ObjectStackAdapter`'s feature
  detect (`typeof client.data.batchTransaction === 'function'`) routes
  master-detail cross-object saves through the typed SDK method instead of the
  raw `fetch('/api/v1/batch')` fallback — realizing the "verify SDK path" half of
  #2694. The raw-fetch branch stays as a defensive fallback (removal tracked in
  #2694).

- 803558e: feat(data): thread the host's authenticated fetch into `provider: 'api'` data sources (#2725)

  `provider: 'api'` view data sources went through a bare `globalThis.fetch`, so
  custom endpoints (gantt composite trees, report aggregates) carried only
  same-origin cookies while every native `/api/v1/*` request carried
  `Authorization: Bearer` — the moment cookie HMAC verification failed (dev
  restart rotating the fallback auth secret, cookie expiry/rotation in prod)
  those views 401'd while the rest of the app kept working.

  - **`@object-ui/react`** — `SchemaRendererProvider` accepts an optional
    `apiFetch`; nested providers inherit it from their parent so re-wrapped
    subtrees (react pages, preview surfaces) keep the host's authentication.
    `useViewData` defaults the api-provider adapter's fetch to the context
    `apiFetch` (explicit `adapterOptions.fetch` still wins).
  - **`@object-ui/auth`** — `createAuthenticatedFetch` gains a
    `sameOriginOnly` option: cross-origin URLs pass through to the bare fetch
    with no `Authorization` / `X-Tenant-ID` / `Accept-Language`, so metadata-
    supplied third-party URLs never see the platform token.
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — the console wires
    `createAuthenticatedFetch({ sameOriginOnly: true })` (settle-signal wrapped)
    as `apiFetch` on the root `SchemaRendererProvider`.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-gantt`** — `ObjectGantt` resolves its api-provider
    DataSource with the context `apiFetch`, covering reads and write-backs.

  Behaviour is unchanged for hosts that don't provide `apiFetch` (bare fetch +
  cookies, as before).

- 5606ca8: fix(plugin-gantt): align the task-list header with the row date columns

  Every data row reserves a trailing w-6 (+4px) slot for the 「→」 open-details
  button whenever `onTaskClick` is live, but the header row didn't — so the
  开始/结束 header labels sat 28px to the right of the date values they caption.
  The header now mirrors the slot under the same condition.

- 1100a8b: feat(plugin-gantt)!: remove the 移动端二维码 (mobile QR share) context-menu item

  The QR-share feature is removed outright: the context-menu item, the QR dialog,
  the `taskUrl` prop on `GanttView`, the URL wiring in `ObjectGantt`, the
  `gantt.menu.qrcode` / `gantt.qr.*` i18n keys (en/zh) and the `qrcode`
  dependency are all deleted. It baked one consumer's app-specific requirement
  (scan-to-open on mobile) into the generic gantt renderer, and what it encoded —
  the desktop console record URL — was not even the right target for that
  requirement. Apps that need scan-to-mobile flows should implement them
  app-side against their own mobile surface.

- 7a5750e: chore(lint): clear the baseline lint errors in plugin-gantt (objectui#2713 Wave 3)

  Wave 3 of the #2713 lint-gate restoration. `@object-ui/plugin-gantt` was red at
  baseline on `main`; cleared every **error** (no behavior change; warnings out of
  scope). 18 of the 21 were in the demo harness:

  - **`react-hooks/static-components` (demo, ×8)** — the `Swatch` legend cell was
    defined inside `ManufacturingLegend`; hoisted to module scope (purely
    props-driven, so nothing from render scope is captured).
  - **`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` (demo, ×9)** — `App` had a `?quickfilter=1`
    early return before ~9 hooks; moved that route below all hooks so hook order
    is stable (the quick-filter branch renders `<QuickFilterDemo />` regardless).
  - **`react-hooks/purity` (demo, ×1)** — the demo render-timer necessarily reads
    `performance.now()` during render (paired with an effect that measures elapsed
    ms); justified scoped disable, demo-only.
  - **`object-ui/no-synthetic-event-trigger`** (`GanttView.interactions.test`) —
    the Escape-closes-menu test dispatched a raw `window` `KeyboardEvent`; switched
    to `fireEvent.keyDown(window, { key: 'Escape' })` (the pattern already used
    elsewhere in the same file). The window-level Escape listener behaves
    identically.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`GanttView`, `ObjectGantt`) — dropped two dead
    initializers (`ok`, `options`) that their exhaustive `try`/`catch` and
    `if`/`else` branches overwrite before reading.

- a506e6d: ObjectGantt now supports the `api` data source for **both read and write-back**.
  Previously `provider: 'api'` logged "API provider not yet implemented" and rendered
  nothing, and every write-back (reschedule, dependency edit, delete, drawer
  inline-edit) was hard-wired to the context ObjectQL `dataSource` + `objectName`,
  so the api provider's `write` config was never used.

  All reads and writes now flow through a single adapter resolved by
  `resolveDataSource(schema.data, dataSource)`: `object` → context DataSource
  (unchanged), `api` → `ApiDataSource` (executes the `read`/`write` HttpRequest
  config), `value` → in-memory `ValueDataSource`. A pure-api view needs no
  `objectName` and no context `dataSource` prop. Object-backed views are behavior-
  preserving. Lookup/master_detail quick-filter option domains still resolve from
  the context object backend (they degrade to distinct in-row values when absent).

- 42b36c4: 新增逐任务预警描边(#2436 第 3 项):视图配置 `borderColorField` 指向
  记录上的预警颜色字段(常为服务端计算的超期/临期字段),该行条形在保留
  原有填充色的同时,以该颜色描边并加 2px 光晕——任务条、里程碑菱形、
  汇总条均生效。语义色名(red/orange/…)映射为调色板 hex,其余 CSS 颜色
  原样透传;空值不描边。开启关键路径高亮时,关键路径样式在其标记行上优先。
- 8a7d5af: 拖拽连线增加内建校验与宿主否决钩子(#2436 第 1、2 项)。落点为锁定行
  (`locked`)或分组行(`type: 'group'`)时,悬停不再高亮、松手不再创建;
  成环依赖(直接回边、跨层级传递回边)基于**全量任务集**检测并拒绝——不受
  折叠子树导致可见连线缺边的影响。新增 `onBeforeDependencyCreate(source,
target, type)` 钩子,在内建校验通过后调用,返回 `false` 可否决本次连线
  (即 DHTMLX `onBeforeLinkAdd` / Syncfusion `actionBegin` 惯例)。
  `wouldCreateDependencyCycle` 从 `scheduling` 导出并单测覆盖。
- eef832b: 修复记录抽屉绕过甘特图行级锁定的问题(#2436 第 5 项)。

  - `RecordDetailDrawer` 的编辑/删除能力现在由调用方是否传入 `onFieldSave` / `onDelete` 决定:两者都省略时抽屉严格只读(无内联编辑、无删除入口)。此前抽屉硬编码 `inlineEdit` 与 `showDelete: true`,并无条件向内层 DetailView 传包装函数,导致锁定记录仍可"编辑"(且改动静默丢失)。
  - `ObjectGantt` 对 `lockField` 锁定的行、以及全局 `readOnly` 的甘特图,不再向抽屉传入 `onFieldSave` / `onDelete`,与时间轴上禁止拖拽/调整的行为保持一致。

- 0b03b34: 快速筛选改为树感知(#2436 第 4 项):命中任务的**全部祖先链**一并保留。
  此前 `displayTasks` 是平铺过滤,项目/产品等分组行本身没有可筛字段值,
  一筛就被丢掉,命中的子任务成孤儿、树结构被打散。现在祖先随命中下级
  自动保留、无命中下级时照常剔除,多分支命中共享祖先不重复。
- 07b2cda: 甘特图写后回读 + 工具栏手动刷新按钮(#2436 第 6/7 项)。

  - 拖拽改期、依赖增删、抽屉内联编辑、删除记录成功后,静默重新读取数据源,让服务端重算的字段(父级汇总、预警颜色、工期重算)刷新到图上;此前乐观补丁只保留客户端写入的字段,派生字段一直陈旧直到整页刷新。静默刷新不闪 loading、不卸载 GanttView(保留滚动/折叠状态),并发请求按序号防乱序覆盖;失败时保留屏上最后一份好数据。
  - GanttView 工具栏新增手动刷新按钮(`onRefresh` / `refreshing` props),object 数据源自动接线;内联 value 数据无可回读来源,不显示按钮。

### Minor Changes

- 995c85d: Gantt feature parity, Phases 1–5: dependency links, real time scales, hierarchy, interaction polish, and virtualization.

  - **Dependency links** — `task.dependencies` renders as orthogonal arrows in an SVG overlay, with all four MS-Project link types (`fs`/`ss`/`ff`/`sf`) via the object form `{ id, type }`. Arrows follow bars live during drag/resize; hovering a bar highlights its links. `normalizeDependencies` (exported) accepts CSV strings, id arrays, and object arrays with id/type aliases. New dependencies can be created by dragging from a bar's link dot onto another bar (`onDependencyCreate`).
  - **Real time scales** — day/week/month/quarter modes with a two-row header (group row + unit row), weekend tinting, zoom in/out, and a jump-to-today button.
  - **Hierarchy** — `parent` builds a tree: collapsible summary rows with bracket-style summary bars aggregated from descendants, milestone diamonds, indent guides, and `aria-expanded`/`role="treeitem"` semantics. Dragging a summary bar moves its whole subtree by the same offset (live preview + one `onTaskUpdate` per task); the summary's displayed range rolls up from children, so moving a child past the parent's edge stretches the parent automatically.
  - **Interaction polish** — progress drag handle, hover tooltip, context menu (including delete), keyboard navigation/editing, inline title editing, and row drag-reorder (`onTaskReorder`).
  - **Scale** — virtualized rows _and_ columns (spacer-based windowing; only the visible window is in the DOM, verified: 5,000 tasks render in ~27 ms with 26 rows in the DOM), a fullscreen toggle, and custom timeline `markers` (`{ date, label?, color? }`).

  Colors that the prebuilt components stylesheet doesn't emit utilities for use theme CSS variables inline, so everything renders correctly in consuming apps.

- 053c948: feat(gantt): year scale, navigation, saved layout, and PDF export (follow-up to #1672)

  - **Year scale** — new `year` granularity (one column per year, with a "20XXs"
    decade group band above); ResourceWorkload follows the same column width/label.
  - **Navigation** — toolbar gains _This week_ / _This month_ jump buttons (beside
    the existing _Today_), scrolling the timeline to the current week/month start.
  - **Saved layout** — `persistLayoutKey` / `onLayoutChange` plus a "Save layout"
    button snapshot the current granularity + zoom + collapsed task columns to
    `localStorage` (`gantt-layout:<object>:<view>`) and restore on next load (an
    explicit `viewMode` prop still wins). `ObjectGantt` derives the key from the
    data object by default; `persistLayout: false` opts out.
  - **PDF export** — rasterizes the whole chart SVG to JPEG embedded in a
    zero-dependency single-page PDF (DCTDecode), alongside PNG export
    (`buildExportSvg` shared by both).

- 053c948: feat(gantt): configurable hover tooltip + live parent-stretch (follow-up to #1672)

  - **Configurable tooltip** — a view declares `tooltipFields` on its gantt config
    (field names, or `{ field, label }` to override the label); `ObjectGantt`
    resolves each against the record (select options → label, lookups → embedded
    record name, dates/numbers/currency/percent through the shared `@object-ui/
fields` formatters) and feeds `GanttView` a `task.fields` array that replaces
    the default hover detail.
  - **Live parent-stretch** — a summary bar's displayed range rolls up from its
    children live, so dragging a child past the parent's edge stretches the parent.
  - Also replaces six prebuilt-CSS utilities the components stylesheet never emits
    (connector dot `-right-2` was occluding the progress label, resize-handle
    width, progress-fill radius, grid z-index, `sm:` variants) with inline styles
    / a scoped media query so the chart renders correctly in consuming apps.

### Patch Changes

- 0ad72a6: fix: pass full gantt config to renderer, render multi-value lookups in gantt tooltips, persist `bodyExtra` on dataSource actions, and complete zh/en gantt labels

  Four platform gaps that the EHR app previously worked around with `node_modules` patches:

  - **app-shell / ObjectView** — the `config.gantt → renderer props` adapter was a hardcoded 6-field whitelist, so `parentField`/`typeField` (and `baseline*`, `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `tooltipFields`, `quickFilters`, …) never reached the renderer and the chart degraded to a flat list. It now spreads the full `viewDef.gantt` first, then applies the three required defaults last (mirroring the gallery branch).
  - **plugin-gantt / ObjectGantt** — the tooltip value formatter only handled single-object lookups, so a multi-value lookup (a populated `[{name},{name}]` array) fell through to `'—'`. It now maps each array element to its display value and joins them.
  - **app-shell / useConsoleActionRuntime** — `bodyExtra` was merged only on the absolute-HTTP path; the generic `dataSource.update` path ignored it, so a pure-confirmation action (no params array) left an empty payload and persisted nothing. `bodyExtra` is now merged last on that path too, matching the documented semantics.
  - **i18n** — added the gantt labels the 9.x renderer references but the bundles lacked: `toolbar.thisWeek/thisMonth/exportPdf/saveLayout`, `viewMode.year`, `menu.add*/removeDependency/noCandidates`, the `linkType.*` and `conflict.*` blocks, and `readOnly*` — in both `en` (canonical key source) and `zh`.

- bd8b054: fix(currency): resolve the tenant default currency across the long-tail renderers

  Phase 2b of the currency-resolution work (ADR-0053). The cell/field renderers
  already funnelled through `resolveFieldCurrency` + `useLocalization` (#1856),
  but the rest of the renderers still hard-coded `USD` or read only one of
  `currency`/`defaultCurrency`. They now share the same resolution chain — explicit
  field currency -> `currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` -> legacy `defaultCurrency` ->
  tenant `localization.currency` -> plain number:

  - `plugin-dashboard` `ObjectMetricWidget` (inferred currency), `ObjectDataTable`
    (symbol-format fallback).
  - `plugin-grid` `useColumnSummary` (footer agrees with the cells) and
    `ObjectGrid` (compact amount + name-inferred currency cells).
  - `plugin-detail` `DetailView` summary metrics.
  - `plugin-gantt` `ObjectGantt` currency tooltips.
  - `components` `element:number` (`format: 'currency'`) — tenant default instead
    of a baked-in `USD`, and renders with the tenant locale.

  `resolveFieldCurrency` now lives in `@object-ui/i18n` (co-located with
  `useLocalization`, which supplies the tenant default); `@object-ui/fields`
  re-exports it, so the existing import path is unchanged. No behavior change when
  no tenant currency is configured — a field that declares its own currency, or a
  deployment with no `localization.currency`, renders exactly as before.

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- cab6a93: **plugin-grid:** column summary footer now formats values using the
  column's type metadata. Currency columns render `Sum: $1,760,000.00`
  instead of bare `Sum: 1,760,000`; percent columns honor `0–1` vs
  `0–100` value ranges; avg uses two fraction digits. `useColumnSummary`
  accepts an optional `fieldMetadata` map (typically `objectSchema.fields`)
  so per-field `type`, `currency`, `defaultCurrency`, `precision` are
  respected.

  **plugin-gantt:** added safe-fallback `useGanttTranslation` hook. All
  hardcoded toolbar `aria-label`s and the `Task Name` / `Start` / `End` /
  `Today` column-header strings now flow through `t('gantt.*')`. A new
  `gantt.*` section is exported from the en/zh/ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/ru/ar
  locales.

  **app-shell:** `ReportView` no longer hardcodes the `Edit` button label
  or the `Loading report…` fallback — they now use `common.edit` and
  `common.loading`.

  **i18n:** added top-level `gantt` section (with English fallbacks in
  non-en/zh locales) and the `common.addToFavorites` /
  `common.removeFromFavorites` keys across all ten built-in locales so
  the `builtInLocales` parity tests pass.

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

## 3.4.0

### Patch Changes

- a2d7023: End-user feature batch — forms, designer history, import/export, and PWA offline sync.

  **Forms (`@object-ui/fields`, `@object-ui/providers`)**

  - `FileField`: native `<input capture="environment">` camera capture for mobile devices, plus a uploading-progress indicator driven by `UploadProvider`.
  - `ImageField`: per-image inline crop/rotate via the lazy-loaded `ImageCropperDialog` (canvas-based, zero new deps).
  - New `UploadProvider` in `@object-ui/providers` with pluggable adapters for S3 and Azure Blob (plus the default object-URL adapter for local previews). XHR-based with progress, abort, and retry.
  - `LookupField`: `lookup.dependsOn: string | string[]` to chain dependent lookups (e.g. State depends on Country); the trigger is gated until parent values are present and the OData `$filter` is built automatically.

  **Container-aware widget widths (`@object-ui/components`)**

  - New `useResizeObserver(ref)` hook exposing `{ width, height }` of any element. SSR-safe; reads the initial size via `getBoundingClientRect`.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-kanban` now react to their container size instead of `window.innerWidth`, so they behave correctly inside split panels and dashboards.

  **Designer history (`@object-ui/plugin-designer`)**

  - `useUndoRedo` (and therefore `useDesignerHistory`) gains `persistKey` + `storage` options to round-trip the undo/redo stack through `sessionStorage`, plus a `clearPersisted()` cleanup helper. Drafts now survive accidental tab refreshes.
  - New `<HistoryPanel>` component renders the timeline visually with one-click jump-to-checkpoint via the new `jumpTo(index)` API.

  **Import wizard (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**

  - Saved column-mapping templates: name, save, re-apply, and delete via a new template bar in the mapping step. Persisted under `objectui:import-templates:${objectName}` (override via `templateStorageKey` / `templateStorage`).
  - Inline validation correction: cells with errors in the preview step are now editable; corrections feed straight into the import without requiring a re-upload, with green-bar status indicators for fixed rows.

  **PWA offline sync (`@object-ui/mobile`)**

  - New `MemoryOfflineQueue` / `IndexedDbOfflineQueue` (`createOfflineQueue()` picks the best backend) backed by IndexedDB.
  - `createOfflineDataSource(inner, { queue })` wraps any DataSource so mutations issued while offline (or that fail with a network-style error) are queued and replayed in order on reconnect. Includes `replay()`, `drop()`, `clear()`, `pending()`, an `onChange` notifier, and an opt-in `resolveConflict` hook for stale-write conflicts.
  - New `useOfflineSync(source)` hook exposes `{ isOnline, pending, isReplaying, replay, drop, clear }` and auto-replays on the browser's `online` event.
  - `getServiceWorkerSource(opts)` emits a customisable Service Worker that pre-caches the app shell, applies network-first to API requests, and broadcasts `REPLAY_QUEUE` to clients on Background Sync. `requestBackgroundSync(tag)` registers a one-shot sync from the page.

- e93fe35: Mobile UX round 3 — Gantt and Map

  **@object-ui/plugin-gantt**

  - Added a sticky vertical "Today" marker on the timeline plus a one-tap **Jump to Today** toolbar button so on-call users can re-orient the view instantly on small screens.
  - Added a **collapsible task list** (toolbar toggle + auto-collapse on the first narrow render) so the timeline area gets the full viewport on phones.
  - Added **pinch-to-zoom** touch gestures on the timeline; wired `columnWidthOverride` state so the existing zoom buttons also respond (previously a no-op).

  **@object-ui/plugin-map**

  - Added a **geolocate button** with the standard `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` permission flow, an inline error banner, a busy state, and a **user-location marker** (blue dot) the map flies to on success.
  - **Cluster tap-through**: tapping a cluster now flies the map in (zoom + 2, capped at 20) instead of just sitting there.
  - On mobile, the desktop popup is replaced by a **bottom-sheet record card** with safe-area padding and an explicit close button. Desktop continues to use the popup.
