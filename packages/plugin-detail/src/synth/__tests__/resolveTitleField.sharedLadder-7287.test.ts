/**
 * objectui#7287 — `resolveTitleField` must BE the shared ADR-0079 ladder, not a
 * second one that happens to agree.
 *
 * ADR-0079 collapsed ~6 divergent record-title resolvers (`record-title.ts`'s
 * own header tells that story, and the "Untitled everywhere" bug it produced).
 * `plugin-detail` grew one back: a private ladder topped by `def.primaryField`
 * — a `DetailViewSchema` key (`@object-ui/types` `views.ts`) read off an
 * OBJECT def — with a literal `['name','full_name','title','subject',
 * 'display_name']` walk underneath that matches on NAME with no type check.
 *
 * These tests pin the two halves that a second ladder cannot give you:
 *
 *  1. the `primaryField` rung is GONE (each test here goes red the moment it
 *     returns to the chain — that is what makes them discriminating rather
 *     than merely descriptive);
 *  2. the detail page, the list column and the lookup chip resolve the SAME
 *     field for the same object — asserted against core's OTHER consumers
 *     (`getRecordDisplayName`, `leadWithNameField`), not by re-reading
 *     `resolveNameField` back at itself, so the assertions still mean
 *     something if the delegation is ever unwound.
