/**
 * `record:details`' dedupe asks the ADR-0079 resolver WHICH ROW to hide
 * (objectui#8175).
 *
 * ## The surface under test is the DEDUPE, not the title
 *
 * This renderer does not draw the H1. It draws the body grid and drops from it
 * the one field whose value the page H1 is already showing. The H1 is drawn a
 * package away by `@object-ui/components`' `PageHeaderRenderer`, whose chain
 * ends with the unified ADR-0079 resolver and only then the same six-name
 * literal walk this ladder used to be. So a TITLE-only pin passes while this
 * ladder is wrong — the two halves are decided in different packages, and
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/page-header-title.test.tsx` (case
 * `nameField wins over a record-level 'name' value`) is already green on
 * `origin/main` with this defect fully present. Every case below therefore
 * asserts which row RENDERS and which row DROPS.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases pin
 *
 * The ladder had no equivalent of the resolver rung, so for an object whose
 * declared `nameField` names a field the six-entry literal walk does not know,
 * BOTH halves of the dedupe were wrong at once: the duplicate row survived
 * (`contract_no`, the value the H1 shows) and an ordinary field disappeared
 * instead (`name`, a row the H1 never showed).
 *
 * ## Why the resolver rung is UNROLLED into two candidates
 *
 * `resolveNameField` returns ONE answer and short-circuits: a declared
 * `nameField` wins outright and the type-aware derivation never runs. This
 * ladder is VALUE-keyed — the header's own chain re-tries the next rung when a
 * rung's value is empty on the record (`getRecordDisplayName` step 1+2 falls to
 * step 4 when `recordDisplayValueAt` comes back undefined). Delegating to `resolveNameField`
 * alone would therefore lose the derivation rung for every record whose
 * declared pointer happens to be blank. The two rungs are listed separately so
 * the value-keyed walk can fall through exactly the way the H1's does.
 *
 * ## What the rows are keyed by (objectui#8269's trap, measured here)
 *
 * The dedupe filters entries through `columnIdentity`, which is CANONICAL-first
 * (`field` beats `name`/`fieldName`), while `DetailSection` renders each row
 * from `field.name`. For the shapes these fixtures use — bare strings — the two
 * are the same string, so "the resolver's answer" and "the column the row
 * carries" cannot coincide by accident. A deliberately conflicting entry
 * (`{ field, name }` disagreeing) is a different, pre-existing defect shape that
 * `hasConflictingColumnIdentity` already names; it is NOT pinned here.
