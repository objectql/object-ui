/**
 * objectui#6697 (item 1) — `RelatedList`'s collection fetch must survive a
 * DISCARDED `defaultSortSpec` / `listFilterNode` memo.
 *
 * The family contract (objectui#6018/#5976/#6591/#6592/#6698/#6701): `useMemo`
 * is a pure optimisation, not a correctness dependency. React is permitted to
 * throw a memo's cache away and recompute even when the dependency array
 * compares equal, so an effect whose OWN dependency array names the memoised
 * OBJECT re-runs on a discard alone. Here that meant an extra
 * `dataSource.find` for the related collection with nothing an author or a
 * caller controls having changed.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE FAMILY'S USUAL DISCARD PROXY DOES NOT WORK ON THIS COMPONENT.
 * The pins for `ObjectMap`/`ObjectTree` force the recompute by handing the
 * component a NEW prop reference carrying equal content, because those memos
 * are keyed on the prop object itself. `RelatedList`'s two memos are already
 * keyed on `JSON.stringify`-derived STRINGS (`defaultSortKey` / `filterKey`),
 * so a new `defaultSort` / `filter` reference with equal content produces an
 * EQUAL key and the memo simply keeps its cache — the trigger would never fire
 * and the pin would pass no matter what the source said. That is exactly how
 * `ObjectCalendar`'s first pin in #6592 came out green pre-fix: a pin that
 * cannot fail is indistinguishable from a working guard.
 *
 * So this file forces the DISCARD ITSELF instead of varying a prop. `useMemo`
 * is replaced at the MODULE level, because it cannot be replaced any other
 * way: `RelatedList` reaches it through `import * as React from 'react'`, and
 * that namespace is a frozen `[object Module]` — `vi.spyOn`, plain assignment
 * and `Object.defineProperty` all fail on it ("Cannot redefine property"),
 * while patching the separate `import React from 'react'` interop default
 * object succeeds and reaches NOTHING in this component. Measured in this
 * session: a first draft that patched only the default binding reported all
 * four cases green against the UNFIXED source. `provesTheProxyDiscriminates`
 * below is the permanent guard against that recurring.

/**
 * Armed per-test by `armDiscardProxy`. While `markers` is empty the mock below
 * is a pure pass-through, so every other test in this file sees stock React
 * semantics. `epoch` is what actually fires a discard: it is appended to the
 * deps of every MARKED memo, so bumping it once invalidates exactly those
 * caches, exactly once. (Appending unconditionally while armed also keeps the
 * deps array a CONSTANT length for the lifetime of a marked memo — arming
 * mid-test would otherwise change its size between renders, which React
 * reports as a warning and handles on its own terms.)
