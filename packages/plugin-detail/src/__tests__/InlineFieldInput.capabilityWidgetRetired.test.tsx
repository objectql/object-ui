/**
 * Retirement pin — the `capability-multiselect` widget hint (objectui#3308,
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
 *
 * `InlineFieldInput` used to special-case `field.widget ===
 * 'capability-multiselect'` and render `CapabilityMultiSelectField`. It was the
 * hint's ONLY surviving consumer: no producer stamps it (ADR-0056 P1 stamps
 * `permission-facet-link` on all six `sys_permission_set` facets, including
 * `system_permissions`), and `field:capability-multiselect` was registered only
 * on the docs-site-only `registerFields()` path, so the form path never resolved
 * it. Keeping one honoring surface for a name nothing emits and no form resolves
 * is the declared-vs-enforced split #3308 was filed about, inverted.
 *
 * Contract now: an unregistered/retired widget hint degrades to the field's
 * declared `type` renderer — the same behavior every other unknown hint gets.
 *
 * Reverse-verified: restoring the deleted branch turns this file red (the picker
 * renders its "Loading capabilities…" placeholder and no text input carries the
 * stored JSON).
