 * objectstack#7118 — `record:related_list.filter` reaches the query.
 *
 * The spec declares `RecordRelatedListProps.filter` ("Additional filter criteria
 * for related records") and this repo published it as a registry input; nothing
 * read it. `RelatedList` built its query from `{ [referenceField]: parentId }`
 * alone, so an author who wrote `filter` got EVERY child of the parent — no
 * error, `os validate` green, the SDUI prop walk green (a declared key raises no
 * `unknown-prop`), and a list wider than the metadata asked for. Same shape as
 * objectstack#4413: declared, validated, unconsumed.
 *
 * Both directions are pinned here, and the second is the one that keeps the fix
 * honest: with nothing authored the query must stay the object it always was
 * (`{ account: 'ACC-1' }`), not a freshly lowered AST that happens to mean the
 * same thing — the difference is invisible on screen and visible to every caller
 * that pins the wire.
 *
 * The composition itself is not re-litigated here (that is #5576's suite): what
 * this file pins is that the value ARRIVES, that the parent scope survives it,
 * and that it goes through the repo's single filter sink rather than a private
 * conversion.
