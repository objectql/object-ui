 * `record:quick_actions` — the registered `actionNames` description describes
 * what the renderer does (objectui#4663).
 *
 * The registry `inputs` ARE the published authoring surface: `gen-manifest.ts`
 * serializes them into `sdui.manifest.json` and the JSX authoring types, and
 * Studio tooling teaches authors from these sentences. The `actionNames`
 * description promised a fallback that exists on no path —
 *
 *   > 'Action names to expose, in order (else every action declared for the
 *   >  object at this location)'
 *
 * — and it was believed: objectstack#8744's dispatch prompt quoted it verbatim
 * as a declared input, and this is the clause that failed verification there.
 *
 * The measured chain, which the first two cases drive for real rather than
 * restate: no `actionNames` and no host `actions` → `namesToResolve` is empty →
 * `needsLookup` is false → the object metadata is NEVER queried → `actions` is
 * `[]` → the dashed placeholder renders. Per the triage ruling on #4663 the
 * fallback is a behaviour EXPANSION and is not being implemented here, so the
 * sentence is what changes; these cases are what stops it drifting back into a
 * promise.
 *
 * The metadata provider below is deliberately LOADED — it declares an action at
 * this very location — so "the bar stayed empty" cannot be an artefact of a
 * provider that had nothing to give. The control case proves the same wiring
 * delivers that action the moment a name asks for it.
