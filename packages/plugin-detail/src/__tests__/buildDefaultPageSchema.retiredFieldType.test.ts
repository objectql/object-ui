/**
 * Item 6 of objectui#4914 — `deriveHighlightFields`' `HIGHLIGHT_FRIENDLY_TYPES`
 * set, behind the retirement gate (maintainer ruling B, 2026-08-18).
 *
 * Before the gate a field TYPED with the retired spelling was highlight-
 * friendly, so the synthesized detail page put a pill for it on the highlight
 * strip while the same field's own editor answered with a tombstone: one page,
 * two verdicts on one field.
 *
 * ## The second door, and why this file pins both
 *
 * `deriveHighlightFields` selects twice. The type-driven loop is the face the
 * card names — but a `preferred` pass runs FIRST, selects by NAME, never looks
 * at the type, and the very first name it prefers is `owner`. Gating only the
 * named line would have left the exact shape this card is about — a field named
 * `owner` still typed `owner` — reaching the strip through the other door with
 * the fix reading as complete. Both doors are pinned, and the `preferred` one
 * is pinned first because it is the one that would have been missed.
 *
 * ## The idiom that must NOT be disturbed
 *
 * `{ type: 'user', name: 'owner' }` is the migration the tombstone prescribes,
 * and `owner` stays in the `preferred` NAME list for exactly that reason. A
 * pin below renders that shape and requires it to keep its slot — if the gate
 * ever starts reading names instead of types, this is what catches it.
 *
 * Ablation direction, predicted before running: drop the gate and the two
 * refusal pins go RED while every control pin stays green.
