/**
 * `record:details` — what chooses the detail body (objectui#3818).
 *
 * The positive control for the `layout` retirement. `record:details` published
 * `layout: enum ['auto','custom']` describing itself as the body selector
 * ("auto uses the object highlightFields; custom uses explicit sections"), but
 * the renderer's only read tested `'inline'` | `'compact'` — values the schema
 * never permitted — so both legal values took the same branch and the key
 * selected nothing. @objectstack/spec 17.0.0 removed it (objectstack#6946,
 * ADR-0087 D2) and objectui#3818 removes the input and the dead branch here.
 *
 * Deleting a selector is only safe if the REAL selector is pinned, so this
 * file pins the contract that was doing the work all along and is now the
 * documented one: **what you author decides the body.** `sections` renders the
 * explicit groups (the old `custom`); omitting it falls back to the flat body
 * (the old `auto`). Both directions, because the failure this guards is a body
 * that silently comes up wrong — or blank — with no diagnostic anywhere.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO "authoring `layout` changes nothing" ASSERTION HERE. It
 * would be vacuous, and the measurement that says so is worth recording: the
 * deleted branch fed `synthesized.layout`, and `DetailView` never reads
 * `layout` at all (no read site in the file, and it does not spread the schema
 * onward). So the branch was dead TWICE — retired vocabulary AND ignored
 * consumer — and restoring it changes no rendered output. A DOM-equality pin
 * would therefore stay green through the exact regression it appears to guard.
 * The read point is pinned where it can actually go red: the source-text and
 * published-surface assertions in `recordDetailsInputs.spec-parity.test.ts`.

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * objectui#7307 — this file's `/api/v1/security/explain` escape, served here.
 *
 * Nothing below asks for a security verdict, yet every run opened a REAL TCP
 * connection to `http://localhost:3000`. Traced with a stack probe on the
 * network-escape guard's attribution point (measured, not inferred):
 *
 *   RecordDetailsRenderer  packages/plugin-detail/src/renderers/record-details.tsx:302
 *     -> DetailView        packages/plugin-detail/src/DetailView.tsx:290, :296
 *       -> useRecordEditable  packages/plugin-detail/src/useRecordEditable.ts:76
 *         -> `const doFetch = apiFetch ?? fetch`      [the escape]
 *           POST /api/v1/security/explain  (twice per render: edit, then delete)
 *
 * `useRecordEditable` reads the host's AUTHENTICATED `apiFetch` off
 * `SchemaRendererContext` and, with no host supplying one, degrades to the
 * GLOBAL `fetch` by design — a standalone embed must keep rendering rather than
 * crash. Under happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL
 * defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live
 * request. The read is best-effort (a network or parse failure leaves the
 * record editable — fail open), which is why the cases below stayed green while
 * the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches (see
 * `packages/plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.navWidthDefault.test.tsx`).
 * Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it records every URL it is handed and
 * `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the set it serves, so an escape to
 * somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: the permissive
 * verdict, in the two response shapes the two explain hooks read —
 * `{ record: { visible } }` for a single `recordId`, and
 * `{ records: [{ recordId, visible }] }` for a batched `recordIds`. Only the
 * FIRST is reached from this file (every call measured above comes from
 * `useRecordEditable`); the batched branch is kept so this router stays
 * byte-identical to its siblings rather than forking per file.
 * `useRecordEditable` initialises `allowed` to `true` and its failure path
 * leaves it there, so `true` and the absent verdict the failing request
 * produced are the same value at every read site — nothing below reads the
 * verdict at all.
