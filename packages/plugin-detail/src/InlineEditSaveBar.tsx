 * InlineEditSaveBar — the record-level sticky Save/Cancel bar for inline edit
 * (objectui#2407 P1). Reads the shared `InlineEditContext` (draft / editing /
 * saving / error) and commits the WHOLE draft in ONE atomic write, so
 * cross-field validation runs against a consistent record instead of the old
 * per-field save-on-blur loop.
 *
 * Two persistence modes:
 *   - **DataSource mode** (record page): one `dataSource.update(obj, id, draft,
 *     { ifMatch: data.updated_at })` → `refresh()`. A `409 CONCURRENT_UPDATE`
 *     opens `<ConcurrentUpdateDialog>` (reload / overwrite), reusing the OCC UX
 *     that previously lived in `record:details`.
 *   - **Callback mode** (standalone drawer): loops a caller-supplied
 *     `onFieldSave(field, value)` over the draft, preserving the drawer's
 *     existing per-field persistence contract with plugin-gantt/calendar/kanban.
 *
 * While the session is active the bar also owns the record-level keyboard
 * shortcuts (objectui#2572): **Esc** cancels (when no popover/dialog is open)
 * and **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter** saves — both respecting `saving`/`locked`.
 *
 * The bar renders nothing unless the record is actively being edited.
 *
 * ## Validation authority on this surface: the SERVER (objectui#6868)
 *
 * ⚖️ Ruled by the maintainer on 2026-08-31 (decision batch #13, on
 * https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectui/issues/6868). Recorded here
 * because, until that ruling, the inline-edit surface's lack of client-side
 * validation was an ABSENCE, and an absence and a decision look identical in
 * code. This comment is the difference.
 *
 * The ruling, in its own words:
 *
 *   1. 正式记录:行内编辑面的校验权威是**服务端**…此前这是一个「缺席」,现在是
 *      一个「决定」——在相应模块注释写明并指向本裁定。
 *   2. 交付物:把服务端 `VALIDATION_FAILED` 拒绝**映射为就地字段提示**(拒绝信息
 *      已含字段与规则,缺的只是呈现层)——用户不再看到原始服务器错误。
 *   3. ⛔ 不抽取共享求值器。
 *   4. ⛔ 照旧不写第二套校验实现——服务端是唯一规则源,前端只做呈现。
 *
 * What that means for anyone editing this module:
 *
 *   - ⛔ Do NOT add a client-side rule evaluator here, and do NOT call
 *     `buildValidationRules` from this surface. The form surface's producer
 *     emits a react-hook-form rule DESCRIPTOR, not a verdict; RHF is the only
 *     evaluator in the repo, and this package depends on neither. Wiring one
 *     up would create a second rule source that can disagree with the server —
 *     which is precisely how AI-authored metadata gets a green form and a
 *     rejected write.
 *   - ✅ DO present what the server already decided. The refusal envelope is
 *     field-scoped: `@objectstack/objectql`'s validators throw
 *     `VALIDATION_FAILED` with `fields[]`, and `@object-ui/react`'s
 *     `extractFieldErrors` is the ONE in-repo normaliser for it (the same one
 *     `form.tsx` uses). This module reads that normaliser and renders per-field
 *     reasons; it never re-derives a rule.
 *
 * The rule kinds the engine refuses on this surface were measured on a real
 * ObjectQL engine before the ruling: `required` (empty AND null), `minLength`,
 * `maxLength`, `email`, `url`, `min`, `max` — every one a `VALIDATION_FAILED`
 * with the prior value left in storage. So no invalid value reachable here
 * survives the write; the only defect was the SHAPE of the refusal the user saw.

 *
 * Two sources, in strict order, and neither of them guesses:
 *
 *  1. **The envelope.** `extractFieldErrors` — `@object-ui/react`'s single
 *     in-repo normaliser, the same one `form.tsx` reads — accepts the three
 *     shapes a `VALIDATION_FAILED` can arrive in (`validationErrors` from
 *     `@object-ui/data-objectstack`'s re-wrap, `details.fields` from the raw
 *     `@objectstack/client` error, or a bare `fields`) and drops any entry with
 *     no usable `field`. That drop is the point: a wrong mark on an innocent
 *     input is worse than the undirected string it replaces. This is the ONLY
 *     source for the DataSource path, whose write is one atomic multi-key
 *     update — nothing else there can say which key the server refused.
 *
 *  2. **The call shape, in callback mode only.** The drawer's persistence
 *     contract loops `onFieldSave(field, value)` one field at a time, so a
 *     rejection from that call belongs to that field by CONSTRUCTION, not by
 *     inference — the write in flight carried exactly one key. `inFlightField`
 *     is passed only from that loop; the atomic path passes `undefined`, so a
 *     multi-key write can never be attributed this way.
 *
 * ⚠️ This function evaluates NOTHING. It reads the server's verdict and says
 * which input it belongs beside. Adding a rule check here would be the second
 * validation implementation the ruling forbids.
 *
 * Module-local on purpose: its pin drives it through the rendered bar, which is
 * how the mapping is actually reached, so exporting it would widen the module's
 * name surface (and its fast-refresh footprint) for nothing.
