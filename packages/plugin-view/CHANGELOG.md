## 17.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a73b51: `ObjectView` and `ListView` now flatten a view's `map` block through a
  whitelist instead of spreading the whole (untyped) block to the top level.
  
  Both `case 'map'` flatteners used to build the `object-map` schema with
  `...(options.map || {})` — a raw spread of an untyped bag
  (`NamedListView.options?: Record<string, any>`), so any key an author wrote in
  the `map` block reached the top level unfiltered. `ObjectMap`'s own
  `FlatMapConfigKeys = Omit<ObjectMapConfig, 'style'>` declares `style` OUT of
  this flat form (`style` is also `BaseSchema.style`, inline CSS legal on every
  node), so the two disagreed about the same shape. `style` was the live
  specimen: `map: { style: '<url>' }` reached the top level as a CSS-shaped
  `style` key it was never supposed to carry.
  
  Behavior narrowing, stated because it changes what reaches the flattened
  schema: a `map` block key that is not one of `ObjectMapConfig`'s declared
  flat keys (`latitudeField` / `longitudeField` / `locationField` / `titleField`
  / `descriptionField` / `zoom` / `center`) — including `style` — no longer
  reaches the top level of the flattened `object-map` schema. This closes a gap
  rather than removing working behavior: the pinned strict spec view schemas
  accept no `map` block at all today, so no author-facing surface could reach
  this path, and `ObjectMap` already stopped reading a top-level `style` as a
  map style (a dev warning names the correct spelling instead).
  
  The whitelist is DERIVED from `ObjectMapConfigSchema` (`@object-ui/types/zod`)
  rather than hand-listed, so the flatteners and the declaration cannot drift
  apart again — a key added to (or removed from) the schema reaches both
  flatteners without a second edit. `ObjectMap`'s own `FLAT_MAP_CONFIG_KEYS` is
  derived from the same schema for the same reason.
- f1d4748: Remove the retired `striped` / `bordered` / `virtualScroll` list-view surface
  
  objectstack#7176 retired `list.striped`, `list.bordered` and `list.virtualScroll`
  from the spec after measuring every objectui reader as pass-through: each one
  copied the key onward and no renderer ever applied it. objectui stops declaring,
  typing and forwarding them.
  
  Off the chain: the `@objectstack/spec` list-view bridge in `@object-ui/react`,
  `ListView`'s child-view props in `@object-ui/plugin-list`, both `ObjectView`
  relays (`@object-ui/plugin-view` and `@object-ui/app-shell`), the `ObjectGridSchema`
  and `NamedListView` declarations in `@object-ui/types` (interface and zod),
  `ObjectGrid.component.yml` in `@object-ui/components`, and the page-block
  inspector's `striped` / `bordered` toggles in the metadata-admin designer.
  
  Behaviour is unchanged: nothing read these keys, so nothing rendered differently
  for them. Stored view metadata that still carries one keeps validating — the keys
  are simply no longer relayed. `ListViewSchema` continues to take the spec's
  list-view fields by reference, so the protocol's own retirement tombstones
  arrive with the next `@objectstack/spec` bump and reject the keys at the
  authoring boundary. Restoring any of the three as live surface requires an
  implementation card filed first, per the ruling.
- d006ce1: `object-view`: a top-level `conditionalFormatting` no longer reaches the kanban view.
  
  `ObjectView.generateViewSchema`'s kanban branch resolved its rule list from a
  three-link chain: `options.kanban.conditionalFormatting`, then the active view's
  own rule, then `(schema as any).conditionalFormatting` read straight off the
  `object-view` node. The first two links are declared surface. The third was not:
  `ObjectViewSchema` has no such member, the `object-view` registry registration
  does not publish it in `inputs`, and `BaseSchema`'s index signature keeps tsc
  silent — yet it was honoured, because that branch runs exactly when no host
  supplies `renderListView`, which is the path the registered renderer takes.
  
  That one key was the sole counter-example to the objectui#5097 exemption, whose
  stated basis is that its 27 keys are reachable only through the host-supplied
  delegation. Maintainer ruling of 2026-08-19 on objectui#5248 (verbatim
  「全部接受」): Option 2, gated on a liveness check, with Option 1 (declare the key
  on `ObjectViewSchema` and in the registry `inputs`) pre-ruled for the case where
  the check found real authored usage. The check came back empty — no authored
  document in either repo puts `conditionalFormatting` on an `object-view` node
  (objectui docs carry it only on `object-grid`, the authoring skill only on
  `list-view`; objectstack authors no `object-view` node at all) — so the read was
  dropped rather than the key declared.
  
  Behavior change, stated because it is one: an `object-view` node that carried a
  top-level `conditionalFormatting` and rendered a kanban view now renders that
  kanban unformatted. Author the rules where they are declared — under
  `options.kanban.conditionalFormatting`, or on the view — and both keep working
  with the same precedence as before.
  
  Not narrowed: the host `renderListView` delegation still reads the key off the
  `object-view` node and forwards it to the host's list renderer. It remains
  host-composition surface under objectui#5097; only the author-reachable path
  closed. Both halves are pinned in
  `packages/plugin-view/src/__tests__/ObjectView.kanbanConditionalFormatting.test.tsx`,
  and `objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx` now asserts that ZERO exempt keys are read
  outside the host-composition fence.

### Patch Changes

- ad07b65: Four packages stop publishing tooling material in their `dist/`
  
  Each of these packages spelled its build exclusions as `*.test.*`, while this repo's tooling convention is a directory one — `__tests__` / `__mocks__` / `__benchmarks__`, exactly as `TOOLING_FILE` in `scripts/check-phantom-dependencies.mjs` spells it. Any tooling file whose *name* is not `*.test.*` therefore stayed in the emit program and shipped in the tarball. This is the same shape and the same cause as objectui#4006, which fixed `@object-ui/fields` and `@object-ui/plugin-editor` by the filename criterion and so did not reach these four.
  
  Measured by building each package from a cleared `dist/` on both sides of the change. Nine files disappear, none appears, and every surviving file is untouched — the totals move by exactly the count removed:
  
  | package | `dist/` files | removed |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `@object-ui/core` | 176 to 174 | `dist/__benchmarks__/core.bench.js`, `core.bench.d.ts` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-designer` | 70 to 66 | `dist/__tests__/__mocks__/plugin-form.d.ts`, `plugin-grid.d.ts`, and both `.d.ts.map` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid` | 62 to 60 | `dist/__tests__/explainDouble.d.ts` and its `.d.ts.map` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-view` | 13 to 12 | `dist/__tests__/explainDouble.d.ts` |
  
  Only `@object-ui/core`'s had runtime weight. The other eight are declarations nothing resolves, but `core.bench.js` is a real emitted module whose first import is `import { bench, describe } from 'vitest'` — a runtime import of a package a consumer never installs, since `vitest` is a devDependency of `@object-ui/core` and devDependencies are not installed transitively. Nothing resolves it today either (it is not in the `exports` map), so no consumer breaks in either direction; this is the tarball shedding files nothing reached.
  
  No type coverage leaves with the emit. The three plugins' helper and mock files are already program inputs of the `tsconfig.test.json` that each package's `type-check` chains, reached through the imports in the suites beside them — `tsc --listFiles` names all four files on both sides of the change. `core.bench.ts` had no such edge, since nothing imports a benchmark, so it is now named explicitly in `packages/core/tsconfig.test.json`. That move was deliberate rather than forced: `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs` enumerates `*.test.ts(x)` only, so a benchmark that no program reads is invisible to it, and dropping the coverage silently would have been the "coverage that was right by accident" objectui#4006 recorded. Verified by appending a provably-false annotation to the benchmark, which turns `tsc -p packages/core/tsconfig.test.json` red at exit 2.
- 20bc99f: `ObjectView` forwards the canonical `table` keys — `pagination` / `selection` / `filter` / `sort` now take effect, and the deprecated spellings keep working as aliases.
  
  `ObjectViewSchema.table` is documented as inheriting from `ObjectGridSchema`,
  but `ObjectView` does not spread it: it forwards a hand-written whitelist of
  keys, and that whitelist carried only the **deprecated** half of four pairs.
  `pageSize`, `selectable`, `defaultFilters` and `defaultSort` were forwarded;
  their canonical successors `pagination`, `selection`, `filter` and `sort` had
  **no read point at all** in the file.
  
  So an author who wrote the shape the type recommends — `table: { pagination:
  { pageSize: 25 } }`, having read `@deprecated Use pagination.pageSize instead`
  on the key they were avoiding — got a view that compiled, read correctly, and
  did nothing. There was no failure signal at any layer: the key is declared on
  `ObjectGridSchema`, `ObjectGrid` already reads it, and only this forwarding hop
  dropped it. That silent success is the defect being closed.
  
  All four canonical keys are now forwarded at every site that forwarded their
  deprecated counterpart: the grid schema, the non-grid data fetch
  (kanban / gallery / calendar / timeline / gantt / map), and the delegated
  `renderListView` schema. When an author writes both spellings the **canonical
  key wins** — it is read first in the chains `ObjectView` resolves itself, and on
  the grid path both slots are forwarded so `ObjectGrid`'s existing canonical-first
  resolution decides, keeping the two layers in agreement.
  
  Nothing that worked before changes. The deprecated spellings are still read and
  are still the value used when they are the only one written; no canonical value
  is synthesised from a deprecated one, so `ObjectGrid`'s `pagination`-keyed
  behaviour is untouched for views that only ever wrote `pageSize`. The two
  precedence segments ahead of `table` — a named `listViews` entry, then the
  active view — are untouched, and a named view still outranks a `table` default.
  
  Declaration-surface note: `table` remains `Partial< Omit< ObjectGridSchema, … > >`,
  which the `BaseSchema` index signature collapses to zero declared members, so
  editor completion still offers no keys and a misspelling is still accepted
  silently. That half is deferred to the structural track and is not addressed
  here.
- e22b9d7: `ObjectView` sends a named view's `sort` to the grid slot that can hold it — the declared sort now reaches both the header indicator and `$orderby`.
  
  A named view's sort is an **array**: `NamedListView.sort` is
  `Array< { field, order } >`, and the `views` prop declares an array too.
  `ObjectView` forwarded the resolved view sort into `gridSchema.defaultSort`,
  which `ObjectGridSchema` declares as a **single** `{ field, order }`. The
  arity mismatch had no compile-time witness — `ObjectViewSchema.table`
  collapses to a bare index signature — and both of `ObjectGrid`'s readers then
  failed, in different ways:
  
  - **The header drew nothing.** `parseSchemaSort(schemaSort ?? (schema.defaultSort
    ? [schema.defaultSort] : undefined))` re-wraps an already-array `defaultSort`
    into `[[{ field, order }]]`. Each entry must be a string or an object with a
    string `field`; a nested array is neither, so the entry was skipped and the
    parse returned `[]`. A view that arrived sorted `name desc` looked unsorted,
    and the first click on that column asked for `asc` on a list already `desc`.
  - **The fetch sent nonsense.** `` `${(schema.defaultSort as any).field} ${(schema
    .defaultSort as any).order}` `` reads two absent keys off an array, so the
    request carried the literal string `"undefined undefined"` as `$orderby`.
    `serializeOrderBy` passes a non-empty string through untouched, so that
    reached the server verbatim.
  
  The two view precedence segments (`listViews` entry, then the active `views`
  entry) now ride the **canonical** `sort` slot, declared `string | SortConfig[]`
  — the arity a view actually carries, and the only one of the pair that can
  express a multi-key sort at all. The legacy `defaultSort` slot keeps carrying
  the `table` segment alone and is read exactly as before.
  
  **Precedence is unchanged.** `ObjectGrid` resolves `sort ?? defaultSort`, so a
  view sort still outranks both `table.sort` and `table.defaultSort`, and a
  `table.sort` still outranks a `table.defaultSort` — the same order the non-grid
  fetch and the delegated `renderListView` schema already express. A view that
  supplies no sort forwards exactly what it forwarded before.
  
  This is also the shape the shared sort sink accepts (`convertSortToQueryParams`
  takes `string | SortConfig[]`), so the fix converges on the normalized dialect
  rather than adding another spelling for the sort-sink convergence work to fold
  in later.
- 2426608: `ObjectView` now forwards the canonical `table.columns` on the non-grid paths, not only on the grid one.
  
  `ObjectViewSchema.table` inherits from `ObjectGridSchema`, where `columns` is the
  canonical spelling and `fields` carries `@deprecated Use columns instead`. Only
  one of the file's three field-list read points consulted `table.columns` — the
  grid one. `generateViewSchema`'s shared `baseProps` and the delegated
  `renderListView` schema both read `table.fields` alone, so an author who wrote
  `table: { columns: [...] }` on a non-grid view got an empty field list from a
  schema that compiled and read correctly. Same silent-success shape as
  objectui#5102, different mechanism: not a whitelist that knows only legacy
  spellings, but one that disagreed with itself between two rendering paths.
  
  Both sites now read the canonical key first and keep the deprecated one as a
  working alias, exactly as objectui#5102 settled it for its four pairs. Nothing
  is translated or reshaped on the way through, and precedence is unchanged: a
  named view's `columns`, then the active view's, then the `table` segment.
  
  Where this is observable, measured rather than assumed: `object-kanban` (the
  card fields) and `object-tree` (its flat columns) consume the shared
  `baseProps` field list, and the delegated `list-view` consumes `columns`.
  `object-gallery`, `object-calendar`, `object-timeline`, `object-gantt` and
  `object-map` read no field list off their schema at all, so the forwarded value
  is inert there — before this change and after it.
  
  One shape question the forwarding raised, answered at the boundary:
  `table.columns` is `string[] | ListColumn[]`, and the non-grid slot is a
  names slot (`ObjectKanban` indexes the record by each entry). The object form
  is therefore resolved to field names there with `columnIdentity` — the same
  fold `ObjectGrid` applies to this very value — so one authored `table.columns`
  resolves identically on both paths, and a `ListColumn[]` cannot arrive as a
  non-empty card field list naming nothing (which would suppress ObjectKanban's
  `highlightFields` fallback and render emptier than the bug being fixed). The
  delegated `list-view` slot declares the same union and keeps the value raw, so
  an author's per-column `label` / `width` still reach the list renderer.
- 99d5659: The plugin-view documentation-site page now teaches the keys `ObjectView`
  actually reads, so a copied example renders instead of coming up empty.
  
  `content/docs/plugins/plugin-view.mdx` carried the same fictional key surface
  the README did before it was rewritten: the object name was spelled `object`
  (the real key is `objectName`, the only required one besides `type`), the page
  was organised around a `viewMode` trichotomy that does not exist, and
  `fields` / `mode` / `recordId` / `fieldConfig` / `nestedFields` / `tabs` /
  `filters` / `searchable` / `enableDelete` went with it. None of those is a
  declared member of `ObjectViewSchema`, and none is read anywhere in
  `packages/plugin-view/src`. Because `type: 'object-view'` is genuinely
  registered, a copied example still resolved to a renderer — it just never
  received an `objectName`, and the component's data effects are all guarded on
  it, so the reader got a silent empty view rather than an error.
  
  The Schema API section and every example after it were rewritten against the
  declared surface, with each key measured against the renderer's read points
  before being written: `defaultViewType` (plus `listViews` / `defaultListView`)
  for the list type, `layout` and its drawer/modal/page record surface in place of
  the separate "form view" and "detail view" narratives, `table` and `form` for
  grid and form configuration, `operations` booleans and `onNavigate` in place of
  the `onCreate` / `onUpdate` / `onDelete` callbacks that were never part of this
  contract, and the `show*` toolbar toggles. The examples are now typed
  `ObjectViewSchema` blocks rather than untyped JSON, which makes a missing
  `objectName` a compile error in all fourteen of them — the page previously had
  no assertion at all, since `ObjectViewSchema` inherits an index signature from
  `BaseSchema` that accepts any undeclared key.
  
  Three structural facts are stated outright: `dataSource` is a required prop of
  `ObjectViewProps` and not a schema key; create, edit and read are internal
  states of one record surface rather than authored modes; and `ObjectView`
  forwards a fixed list of keys out of `table` and `form` rather than passing
  those objects through, so the page names exactly which ones — including that
  page size on this path is `table.pageSize`, not `table.pagination`.
  
  The TypeScript Support snippet's `import type { ObjectViewSchema }` also moves
  from `@object-ui/plugin-view`, which does not export it, to `@object-ui/types`,
  where it is declared. Copying the old line produced a TS2305.
- 405d54e: The plugin-view README now documents the keys `ObjectView` actually reads, so a
  copied example renders instead of coming up empty.
  
  Every untyped schema literal in the README was written against a key vocabulary
  `ObjectViewSchema` does not declare and `ObjectView` does not read. The object
  name was spelled `object` — the real key is `objectName`, and it is the only
  required key besides `type` — so a copied example left the component with no
  object to query. Three "view modes" were organized around a `viewMode` key that
  exists nowhere, and `fields`, `mode`, `recordId`, `fieldConfig`, `nestedFields`,
  `tabs`, `searchable`, `sortable`, `filters` and `enableDelete` were documented
  the same way. None of it failed loudly: `ObjectViewSchema` extends a base schema
  carrying a `[key: string]: any` index signature, so excess-property checking is
  defeated on this type, and the blocks carried no type annotation to trip even
  the one assertion that does bite.
  
  The thirteen affected blocks are rewritten against the declared surface, each
  one measured against the renderer before being written: `defaultViewType` (plus
  `listViews` / `defaultListView`) for the list type, `layout` with its
  drawer/modal/page record surface for what the README called form and detail
  views, `table` and `form` for grid and form configuration, `operations`
  booleans and `onNavigate` in place of the `onCreate` / `onUpdate` / `onDelete` /
  `onSubmit` callbacks that were never part of this contract, and the `show*`
  toolbar toggles. Examples now carry `ObjectViewSchema` annotations, which makes
  a missing `objectName` a compile error in all fifteen of them.
  
  Three structural facts are stated outright rather than left to be inferred:
  `dataSource` is a required prop of `ObjectViewProps` and not a schema key, so
  putting it in the schema does nothing; create/edit/read are internal states of
  one record surface rather than authored modes, which is why `ObjectViewSchema`
  omits `mode` from its `form` block; and `ObjectView` forwards a fixed list of
  keys out of `table` and `form` rather than passing those objects through, so the
  README now names exactly which ones — including that page size is `table.pageSize`
  on this path, the spelling the component forwards.
  
  The `ViewSwitcher`, `FilterUI` and `SortUI` sections are untouched: their keys
  were checked against the registered `inputs` and already matched.
- d2cf8fd: docs: README 按真实导出面重写虚构的 `viewComponents` 手动注册,并把 `ObjectViewSchema` 的导入路径改到 `@object-ui/types`
  
  `### Manual Registration` 教的 `viewComponents` 在本包(以至全仓)零命中,照抄第一行就是
  `Object.entries(undefined)` 抛 TypeError;替换为三节真话:七个 `ComponentRegistry.register`
  调用认领的 schema 类型键表、本包 39 个真实导出名、以及把导出组件挂到自定义键的写法。
  
  `ObjectViewSchema` 是真类型,但声明在 `@object-ui/types`,本包只 import 不 re-export,按
  README 原路径导入是 TS2305;改导入路径(未新增任何导出或 re-export),示例键面随之对齐真身
  (`objectName` 必填、`defaultViewType`、`table.columns`)。
  
  无代码/类型/运行时改动。声明 patch 是因为 `README.md` 在包的 `files` 里,随下次发布到 npm。

## 17.5.0

### Patch Changes

- d0c3b26: Every plain `<button>` now declares its `type`. HTML defaults an untyped button to
  `type="submit"`, so any of these buttons would submit the form it was composed into
  instead of running its own handler — a real risk for renderers (`drawer`, `tree-view`,
  `navigation-overlay`) whose placement inside a form is a JSON metadata decision. 114
  sites were converted to `type="button"`; no site was a genuine submit button, and the
  DOM is otherwise unchanged.

  The defect class is now closed mechanically by a new `object-ui/button-has-type` ESLint
  rule (error), so the next untyped button fails CI at write time rather than being found
  by a fourth audit round (objectui#4045, closing the objectui#3344 family).

- 3f5f87c: `SchemaRenderer` states its real contract — a typed, required `schema` and a deliberate forwarding surface

  `SchemaRenderer` is the renderer loop: every registered SDUI component is rendered through it. It handed `forwardRef` a props type of `{ schema: SchemaNode } & Record<string, any>`, which puts `string` into `keyof Props`, so `'ref' extends keyof Props` was always true, React's `PropsWithoutRef` took its `Omit` branch, and `Omit` over a type carrying a string index signature keeps only the index signature. Every declared prop was erased. Measured on the pre-fix source: `keyof ComponentProps<typeof SchemaRenderer>` was `string` and `ComponentProps<typeof SchemaRenderer>['schema']` was `any`, while the type argument went on declaring `SchemaNode`. The other half is the same defect seen from the call site — `<SchemaRenderer />` with no schema at all, `<SchemaRenderer schema={12345} />`, and an arbitrary misspelled prop each type-checked in silence. This is objectui#4422 / PR #4438's trap in the most central component in the repo, spelled `Record<string, any>` rather than `[key: string]: any`, which is why every previous sweep's grep and both shipped guards' detector reported the site as clean.

  Graded **minor, not major**, on objectui#4528's reasoning: the type argument has always DECLARED `schema`; the index signature erased it from the resolved type, and restoring what the declaration documents is a fix to the published contract rather than a contract break.

  **The forwarding surface is kept, deliberately.** This component forwards every prop it does not read to the component the schema names, resolved at runtime from a plugin-extensible registry — `packages/react/README.md` documents exactly that, and `@object-ui/components`' form renderer consumes the `onSubmit` it shows being forwarded. Closing that surface would state a false contract and would force every leaf plugin's props into this package. So the two halves are separated: the `forwardRef` type argument is the honest `SchemaRendererProps`, with no index signature for `PropsWithoutRef` to collapse, and the open surface is stated once in an explicit export annotation, which nothing routes through `Omit`. The published `.d.ts` shows the erasure disappearing: `ForwardRefExoticComponent<Omit<{ schema: SchemaNode } & Record<string, any>, "ref"> & RefAttributes<any>>` becomes `ForwardRefExoticComponent<SchemaRendererProps & Record<string, any> & RefAttributes<any>>`.

  `SchemaRendererProps.schema` is declared as `BaseSchema | string | null | undefined` — what this component actually handles. It previously declared `@object-ui/core`'s `SchemaNode` interface, which requires `type: string` and so contradicted the component's own early returns for strings and nullish, while every caller held `@object-ui/types`' wider union. The erasure hid that mismatch completely.

  **One declared behaviour change.** A non-object, non-string primitive schema now renders as its own text. It previously fell through to the shallow copy `{ ...schema }`, which spreads a primitive to an empty object, lost the `type` the renderer then looked up, and surfaced the red "Unknown component type: undefined" box — an accident of the spread rather than a decision. The declared props type excludes `number` / `boolean` so no author is invited to pass them; the runtime handling is defence-in-depth for untyped callers and stored metadata. Strings, `null`, `undefined`, `0` and `false` render exactly as before, and an object naming an unregistered type still gets the error box; all four are pinned.

  Latent defects the erasure had been hiding, each surfaced by the repo-wide type-check and fixed at its call site: `DashboardRenderer` cast its widget schema to `Record<string, any>`, dropping the `type` every branch of `getComponentSchema` sets; `DashboardGridLayout`'s equivalent now states its return type instead of inferring a union that admitted a shape with no `type`; and `ReportViewer` handed a section's `content` array to the renderer whole, so a multi-node section rendered the unknown-component box instead of its content — arrays are mapped rather than widened into the renderer's declared input.

  A repo-wide structural guard replaces the two per-package siblings' blocked direction: it judges every `forwardRef` in `packages/*/src` (219 sites) and its detector resolves `Record<string, …>` and `string`-keyed mapped types in addition to literal index signatures — the spelling the previous detector went blind on. It judges the type argument only, where an index signature is an accidental eraser, and never an export annotation, where one is a stated contract.

### Patch Changes

- 28b2e65: Localize the create / edit / view form title `ObjectView` builds itself
  (objectui#3462)

  The same family as #3426 / PR #3457 and #3459 / PR #3464, one call site further
  in. `ObjectView.getFormTitle()` string-built its three verbs in TypeScript:

      case 'create': return `Create ${objectLabel}`;
      case 'edit':   return `Edit ${objectLabel}`;
      case 'view':   return `View ${objectLabel}`;

  so a Chinese session whose object is labelled 联系人 read a drawer headed
  **"View 联系人"** — an English verb glued onto a localized label. All three
  consumers are visible chrome: `renderDrawerForm`'s `DrawerTitle`,
  `renderModalForm`'s `DialogTitle`, and the `title` prop handed to
  `NavigationOverlay` in the `popover` branch (a host-supplied `title` displaces
  the overlay's own `resolvedTitle` default, so it is what the user sees).

  The bar to reach it is lower than #3459's split panel: `ObjectViewSchema.layout`
  already defaults to `'drawer'`, and `navigation` is a declared authorable input
  on the registered `object-view` block whose `mode` union carries `drawer`,
  `modal` and `popover`. A row click under any of them sets `formMode: 'view'` and
  opens the container. `app-shell`'s wrapper pinning `layout: 'page'` is one host
  overriding a registered block, not proof the branch is dead.

  ## What changed

  The three verb branches resolve `form.createTitle` / `form.editTitle` /
  `form.viewTitle`.

  **No new key family was minted.** `form.createTitle` (`'Create {{object}}'`) and
  `form.editTitle` (`'Edit {{object}}'`) already ship in all ten packs and are
  already how `app-shell` heads the PAGE-mode record form
  (`RecordFormPage.tsx`, `AppContent.tsx`). The drawer / modal / popover titles are
  the same heading on a different surface, so they resolve the same keys — a
  parallel per-plugin family would have guaranteed the two spellings drift, which
  is what the sibling issues were about. Only the third verb had no sibling:
  `form.viewTitle` is added to all ten packs, following each pack's existing
  arrangement for its create/edit twins rather than a translated-verb-plus-label
  concatenation (de puts the verb last, ja/zh use particles and no space).

  `VIEW_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` in `ObjectView.tsx` gains the three English entries,
  which is what `createSafeTranslation` falls back to with no `I18nProvider`
  mounted.

  Two branches stay literal on purpose and are pinned by tests: `schema.form.title`
  (the author wrote a title, so the author's title wins, in every locale) and the
  `default` branch (bare object label, no verb to translate).

  ## Visible English change

  None. Every branch is byte-identical in English — `Create Contacts`,
  `Edit Contacts`, `View Contacts` — with and without a provider, so e2e specs and
  host tests that address this chrome by its English name keep addressing it. The
  provider-less path has its own test file, kept separate because
  `initReactI18next` registers its instance as a module global that outlives
  `cleanup()`.

  The toolbar's create BUTTON keeps resolving `console.objectView.new`
  ("New" / 新建) and was deliberately not reused for the heading: a button verb and
  a title are different contexts, and folding them together is how the next drift
  of this shape would start.

- aa36e60: Localize the record-detail headings that `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectTree` and
  `ObjectView` build themselves (objectui#3459)

  #3426 / PR #3457 keyed `ListView` and `ObjectGrid`; a repo-wide grep found the
  same pattern in three more hosts, each string-building an English heading in
  TypeScript so the surrounding drawer/panel was fully localized with one English
  phrase on top of it.

  - `packages/plugin-kanban/src/ObjectKanban.tsx` — the object-derived heading of
    the card-detail drawer
  - `packages/plugin-tree/src/ObjectTree.tsx` — the bare literal
    `"Record Details"` handed to `NavigationOverlay`
  - `packages/plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx` — `` `${objectLabel} Detail` `` on
    the `mode: 'split'` panel

  All three are user-reachable, each verified by a test that drives the real
  interaction (render the block, click a card/row, read the heading), not by
  inspection:

  - `object-kanban` is a public page block whose `navigation` config DEFAULTS to
    `{ mode: 'drawer' }`, so a board needs no authoring at all to open this
    drawer on card click;
  - `object-tree` needs `navigation: { mode: 'drawer' }` authored explicitly, and
    every row's click is wired to `navigation.handleClick`;
  - `object-view` declares `navigation` as an authorable input and maps
    `mode: 'split'` onto the branch that renders this heading.

  ## What changed

  Each call site now keys its heading through the existing `detail.*` pair —
  `detail.recordDetailWithLabel` (`'{{label}} Detail'`) where an object label is
  available, `detail.recordDetail` where none is. No new locale keys: both
  already ship in all ten packs from #3457, and reusing them keeps one heading on
  one control instead of minting per-plugin twins that drift.

  Each plugin gains its own English defaults map, which is what
  `createSafeTranslation` falls back to with no `I18nProvider` mounted;
  `@object-ui/plugin-tree` gains a dependency on `@object-ui/i18n` for it.

  ## Visible English change

  One, deliberate: the tree overlay's heading goes from the plural
  `Record Details` to the singular `Record Detail` — the spelling the whole
  `detail.*` family, including `NavigationOverlay`'s own default, already uses.
  The maintainer ruled on normalizing the stray plurals rather than minting a
  plural key; a repo-wide grep confirmed no `e2e/` spec and no unit test
  addressed the old string.

  Every other branch is byte-identical in English (`Contacts Detail`,
  `Support cases Detail`, `Contacts Detail`), with and without a provider —
  pinned by a provider-less test file per plugin, kept separate because
  `initReactI18next` registers its instance as a module global that outlives
  `cleanup()`.

  The kanban's other former plural (`'Card Details'`) is NOT a visible change: it
  sat on a branch that fires only when the board has no `objectName`, while the
  drawer consuming it returns `null` on that very condition. It is keyed anyway
  so the literal cannot leak if that guard ever relaxes, and it deliberately has
  no test — an assertion there would pass because nothing renders.

### Minor Changes

- 5319bf1: feat(views): the list toolbar speaks one vocabulary — `userActions` (#2890 scope A step 3)

  The seven bare `show*` toolbar flags fold into the spec's `userActions`, and the
  renderer reads nothing else. `showDescription` folds into
  `appearance.showDescription` at the same boundary.

  | legacy                                                    | canonical                                                 |
  | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `showSearch` / `showSort` / `showFilters` / `showDensity` | `userActions.search` / `.sort` / `.filter` / `.rowHeight` |
  | `showGroup` / `showHideFields` / `showColor`              | `userActions.group` / `.hideFields` / `.rowColor`         |
  | `showDescription`                                         | `appearance.showDescription`                              |

  **The last three are new keys, and they close a capability hole rather than just
  renaming one.** `@objectstack/spec`'s `UserActionsConfigSchema` documents itself
  as "which interactive actions are available to users in the view toolbar — each
  boolean toggles the corresponding toolbar element on/off", and already carries
  `rowHeight` (objectui's `showDensity` under its spec name). Grouping, column
  visibility and row coloring are the same kind of toggle: the spec models all
  three as _configuration_ (`grouping`, `hiddenFields`, `rowColor`) but has no
  "may the user change it" switch for any of them.

  The consequence was visible in the product. With no `userActions` key to read,
  the two list surfaces **hardcoded opposite policies**: `InterfaceListPage` (the
  author-curated interface page) pinned all three OFF, `ObjectDataPage` pinned two
  ON — and an interface-page author could not turn grouping back on for end users
  at all. Both surfaces now express their policy as `userActions` defaults, which
  an author can override.

  Until the keys land in `@objectstack/spec`, `@object-ui/types` carries them as a
  documented `.extend()` on `UserActionsConfigSchema` (the same shape
  `ListColumnSchema` uses while waiting on objectstack#3761); it collapses into a
  plain re-export once they do. Note the spec schema is not `.strict()`, so before
  this an author writing `userActions: { group: false }` had it **silently
  stripped** — valid on parse, no effect at render.

  Defaults are unchanged and deliberately asymmetric, matching what these flags
  have always done: `search` / `sort` / `filter` / `rowHeight` / `group` are on
  unless turned off; `hideFields` / `rowColor` are off unless turned on. Making
  them uniform would grow two buttons on every existing view, so it is left as its
  own product decision rather than smuggled into a vocabulary migration.

  Also drops a dead relay in app-shell's `ObjectView`, which forwarded
  `showDescription` onto the node although `ListView` has only ever read
  `appearance.showDescription`.

### Patch Changes

- 4545380: fix(view): the spec→FilterBuilder map follows the four operators #2942 added

  `CANONICAL_TO_BUILDER` mapped `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `is_null` and
  `is_not_null` to `null`, with a comment asserting the FilterBuilder had no such
  operator. #2942 gave it `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `isNull` and `isNotNull` —
  and this table did not follow, so a stored view carrying any of the four still
  reached the builder as a raw spelling it could by then have rendered, and the
  comment claiming otherwise was simply false.

  All four now map. `is_null`/`is_not_null` go to `isNull`/`isNotNull` and **not**
  to `isEmpty`/`isNotEmpty`: the builder draws both pairs, and folding the NULL
  predicate onto the empty-string one would silently rewrite the author's operator
  the next time the view was saved.

  **The guard could not have caught this, and now can.** The parity test asserted
  the unmapped set equalled a hand-kept list of gaps — which stays true when the
  _builder_ gains an operator, because neither side of that comparison moves. The
  new assertion is derived instead: `starts_with` and `startsWith` fold to the same
  key, so an unmapped canonical operator whose folded name matches a folded builder
  id is an omission by definition. Verified by reverting the four mappings, which
  reproduces the drift as four named failures.

  The unmapped set is now empty — all 19 canonical `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` members
  translate.

  Refs #2945, #2942, #2989

- c4d7b20: fix(view,list,core): a view's filter no longer disappears, or arrives as a predicate on columns that don't exist

  Sweeping the other `$filter` producers after #3078 turned up two live defects in
  `ObjectView`, which fetches its own data for calendar / kanban / gallery /
  timeline (grid delegates to `ObjectGrid`).

  **1. An object filter was dropped, and only for non-grid views.**
  `table.defaultFilters` is declared `Record<string, any>`, and the merge tested
  `baseFilter.length > 0` — `undefined > 0` for an object. So the filter vanished
  and the view returned **every record**. `ObjectGrid` assigns the same value
  straight to `params.$filter`, so one view definition filtered correctly as a
  grid and returned everything as a calendar.

  **2. Rule objects were spread into the `and`, not wrapped.**
  `['and', ...baseFilter, ...userFilter]` is only correct when the source is an
  array of AST nodes. `activeView.filter` is a spec `ViewFilterRule[]`, so
  spreading put bare rule objects where the AST expects nodes:

  ```js
  isFilterAST([
    "and",
    { field: "stage", operator: "eq", value: "won" },
    ["owner", "=", "me"],
  ]);
  // false → 400 since objectstack#4121
  parseFilterAST(same);
  // {$and:[{field:'stage',operator:'eq',value:'won'}, {owner:'me'}]}
  ```

  That second line is a predicate over three columns named `field`, `operator`

  New in `@object-ui/core`: `toFilterNode` normalizes one source (rule array / AST
  / MongoDB object) and `mergeFilterNodes` combines sources as siblings under one
  `and`. `ObjectView` and `ListView.buildEffectiveFilter` both use them, so the
  three filter shapes are reconciled in one place instead of by hand at each
  renderer.

  `ObjectStackAdapter` also now translates a bare rule object sitting directly
  under a logical node — the chokepoint defence for any producer still emitting
  the spread shape. Only rule-_shaped_ objects are touched; a child with no
  `field` is a genuine MongoDB condition and passes through untouched.

  **Correcting a comment shipped in #3078.** `buildEffectiveFilter` documented the
  dropped-object case as unreachable, "nothing in this repo produces one for a
  list view". That was wrong: `ObjectView` passes `mergedFilters` straight into
  that schema's `filter`, and its last fallback is `table.defaultFilters`. The
  case is now handled rather than explained away.

  Verified with 19 tests across the four packages; reverting each source file
  fails the ones that cover it. Emitted filters are asserted against the spec's
  own `isFilterAST` / `parseFilterAST`, including an executable pin on what the
  old spread shape produced.

- bebaebd: refactor(view): remove ObjectView's filter/sort bar, which was never connected

  `ObjectView` carried its own filter and sort bar: `filterValues` / `sortConfig`
  state, a `filter-ui` schema and a `sort-ui` schema, ~80 lines of field
  introspection to build them. None of it was wired. No setter was ever called and
  neither schema was ever rendered — both states sat at their initial empty value
  for the component's entire life.

  Removed rather than wired, because the real filter and sort UI belongs to the
  renderer this component delegates to. `showFilters`, `showSort` and
  `filterableFields` are forwarded downstream and `ListView` implements them for
  real. Connecting the local copy would have produced a _second_ filter bar
  competing with that one.

  The dead state was not inert, though — it left a branch in every merge path that
  could never run, and those branches read as live code:

  - The fetch path merged `baseFilter` with a `userFilter` that was always `[]`.
  - `mergedFilters` (what the `renderListView` slot receives, used by the Studio
    design surface) opened with a branch that **replaced** the view's filter with
    the user's instead of combining them — which would have been a real bug had
    the state ever been written.

  Two "defects" reported against these branches during #3081 were unreachable for
  exactly this reason; that changeset carries the correction. Keeping code that
  looks live and cannot run is what made the misreading possible twice, which is
  the argument for deleting it rather than leaving it for the next reader.

  No behaviour change: every removed branch was unreachable, and the surviving
  paths are pinned by new tests covering both what the component queries with and
  what it hands the delegated renderer.

- 80edbd4: fix(view,components): the spec→FilterBuilder operator table covers the whole view vocabulary, and the dead write direction is gone

  `view-config-utils`' `SPEC_TO_BUILDER_OP` resolved **10 of the spec's 19
  canonical `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS`**. The nine it missed —
  `not_equals`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `greater_than`, `less_than`,
  `greater_than_or_equal`, `less_than_or_equal`, `is_null`, `is_not_null` — all
  appear in stored view metadata (they are canonical; `ViewFilterRuleSchema`
  validates against exactly this list), and each reached the FilterBuilder as a
  raw spelling its operator dropdown cannot select.

  Same defect and same cause as #2974, one table over: spellings were enumerated
  by hand. That table is now derived from the spec's own canonical list and
  `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES`, matched case- and separator-insensitively, so
  `not_in` / `notIn` / `'not in'` / `NOT_IN` are one entry rather than four
  chances to miss one.

  Four canonical operators have no FilterBuilder equivalent —
  `starts_with`/`ends_with` (absent from its vocabulary) and `is_null`/
  `is_not_null` (distinct from the `is_empty`/`is_not_empty` it does have). They
  are recorded as explicit `null`s and asserted, and deliberately left unmapped:
  folding them onto a near-equivalent would silently rewrite the author's
  operator on the next save, whereas an unmapped operator surfaces as a condition
  row the author must complete.

  Also retired `BUILDER_TO_SPEC_OP` and `toSpecFilter` — the write direction,
  dead since the legacy `buildViewConfigSchema` engine was replaced by the
  studio's spec-driven inspector (no caller anywhere in the repo, and not part of
  `@object-ui/plugin-view`'s public exports). It was objectui's last emitter of
  `'not in'` with a space, plus `before`/`after`, as _filter-AST_ operators —
  spellings that reached the server outside `VALID_AST_OPERATORS` and were dropped
  without an error (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3948).

  `@object-ui/components` now exports `FILTER_BUILDER_OPERATORS` (and the
  `FilterBuilderOperator` type), derived from the operators the FilterBuilder
  actually renders, so tables mapping onto that vocabulary can assert against it
  instead of restating it.

  Refs objectstack-ai/objectui#2945, #2901.

- e4c2783: fix(view): the chart view gets a label and an icon in the view switcher — objectui#2916

  `ViewSwitcher`'s two exhaustive `Record<ViewType, …>` maps — `DEFAULT_VIEW_LABELS`
  and `DEFAULT_VIEW_ICONS` — were each missing the `chart` key. `chart` is a member
  of `ViewType` and `plugin-charts` is a registered view, so a chart tab rendered
  with no icon and with its raw type key `chart` as the label, while every sibling
  view showed a glyph and a capitalized name.

  Both maps now carry `chart`, using the same `BarChart3` glyph and `'Chart'` label
  that `plugin-list`'s switcher, `app-shell`'s `ObjectView`/`CreateViewDialog`, and
  the `console.objectView.viewTypeChart` translation already agree on — so the
  switcher no longer disagrees with the rest of the UI. An explicit per-view
  `label`/`icon` still overrides the default, unchanged.

  Why the compiler did not catch it: `@object-ui/plugin-view` had no `type-check`
  script, so `Record<ViewType, …>` — the exhaustiveness guard that exists precisely
  to make a missing member a compile error — was never evaluated by CI. The package
  now type-checks both its sources and its tests, and its `DEBT` entry in
  `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs` is deleted. Compiling the tests for the
  first time also surfaced three unused destructured spy parameters, and the
  package's one remaining reported error (a `dnd-kit` `SyntheticListenerMap`
  mismatch in `ViewTabBar`) is fixed by typing the listener bag as `dnd-kit`'s own
  exported `DraggableSyntheticListeners` rather than a hand-written structural fork.

## 17.0.0

### Minor Changes

- cd09a7b: refactor(views): ListView reads the spec-canonical `columns`, with legacy `fields` folded in one normalizer (#2890 scope A step 1)

  `ListViewSchema` has been derived from `@objectstack/spec/ui` since #2231, but
  the renderer still spoke objectui's own vocabulary for the same concepts. First
  rename closed: **`fields` → `columns`**.

  Legacy acceptance does not disappear — stored view metadata in user databases
  carries `fields` — but it now lives in exactly one place instead of being
  re-implemented per read-site:

  - **New `normalizeListViewSchema` (`@object-ui/core`)** folds `fields` into
    `columns` (canonical wins when both are present) and drops the legacy key, so
    a read-site that was missed fails loudly instead of quietly taking the legacy
    path. It also absorbs the `viewType` renderability default ListView applied
    inline. Non-mutating, idempotent, and returns its input by reference when
    there is nothing to fold, so ListView's downstream memos keep a stable
    dependency identity.
  - **`ListView` normalizes once at the component boundary**, before anything
    reads the schema. This is what guarantees the fold runs: nothing on the render
    path parses view metadata through zod (the zod schemas serve the CLI
    validator, the VS Code extension and tests), so a `z.preprocess` on
    `ListViewSchema` — spec-side or local — would never execute.
  - **Producers emit `columns`**: `ObjectView`'s `renderListView` payload,
    `ObjectDataPage`, `InterfaceListPage` and the `list-view` registry defaults
    had been _downgrading_ already-canonical `columns` config back to `fields`.

  Two latent inconsistencies go away with it: the filter builder's
  objectDef-not-loaded fallback now resolves `ListColumn.field` (it read only
  `name`/`fieldName`, so object-form columns produced unnamed filter entries), and
  the column list no longer depends on which of the two keys a host happened to
  emit.

  `fields` stays declared on `ListViewSchema` and in the drift guard's sanctioned
  set — it is still valid input, and `@objectstack/spec`'s `react-blocks.ts`
  sanctions it as the React-tier `<ListView fields>` prop — but it is input-only.

- f1abf0e: fix(views): ListView reads the spec-canonical `filter`, so a view's base filter reaches every visualization (#2890 scope A step 4)

  Third rename in the ListView vocabulary migration: **`filters` → `filter`**. Unlike
  the first two this closes a live bug, because the fork was asymmetric.

  `ListView` was the **only** surface in the repo reading `filters`. Every child
  view — `ObjectGrid`, `ObjectGallery`, `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectCalendar`,
  `ObjectGantt`, `ObjectMap`, `ObjectTree`, `ObjectChart` — reads `filter`, and
  `ListView` handed them `filters`. Wherever a child fetches its own rows instead
  of receiving `ListView`'s, the view's base filter was silently dropped:

  - **a `chart` list view aggregated the whole object.** The chart branch built an
    `object-chart` node with `filters:`; `ObjectChart` reads `schema.filter` and
    never read `filters`, so a chart view with a base filter charted unfiltered
    totals.
  - the same applied to any of the other view components rendered standalone from
    a list-view-shaped config.

  Conversely, a **spec-authored** list view — one carrying `filter`, which is what
  the spec says and what `runtime-metadata-persistence` and "Save as view" already
  persist — rendered **unfiltered** in `ListView`, because nothing read that key.

  The fold is a key rename only. Both keys carry an ObjectQL FilterNode array
  everywhere in objectui; every consumer passes the value straight to `$filter`.
  (The spec types `filter` as `ViewFilterRule[]` — `{field, operator, value}`
  objects — so objectui's field is typed from the spec but used as something else.
  That mismatch is real and left alone here: converting formats inside a
  vocabulary fold would change what reaches the data source.)

  Also collapses a duplicated computation in `app-shell`'s `ObjectView`, which
  computed the same effective filter **twice** — once as `filter` for the child
  views, once as `filters` for `ListView` — with the two copies subtly different
  (only one fell back to `listSchema.filter`; only the other ran token
  substitution over the URL filters). There is now one computation, keeping both
  behaviors.

  `filters` stays declared on `ListViewSchema` and in the drift guard's sanctioned
  set — stored views carry it and it is still valid input — but it is input-only.

### Patch Changes

- 6dee2cb: feat(form): consume spec-aligned FormView buttons/defaults in ObjectForm

  The authored `@objectstack/spec` FormViewSchema carries structured
  `buttons.{submit,cancel,reset}.{show,label}` and `defaults`, but the form
  renderer only read the flat renderer-invented `showSubmit`/`submitText`/
  `showCancel`/`cancelText`/`showReset`/`initialValues`. That left the two spec
  keys parsed-but-inert (ADR-0078) and stuck at `experimental` in the spec
  liveness ledger.

  `ObjectForm` now folds the structured shape down onto those flat props inside
  its existing normalization pass, so every entry path (ObjectView
  drawer/modal/page, RecordFormPage) honors it. An explicitly-set flat key still
  wins, so metadata authored against the deprecated flat keys is unchanged.
  `ObjectView` and `RecordFormPage` forward `buttons`/`defaults` from the spec
  form view. `ObjectFormSchema` gains the optional `buttons`/`defaults` fields.

  Refs objectstack-ai/objectstack#1894, objectstack-ai/objectstack#2998.

- 7d46648: fix(hooks): stop calling translation hooks inside try/catch (objectui#2879)

  Eleven call sites wrapped a React hook in `try`/`catch` to make it
  "provider-safe". `useObjectTranslation` and `useObjectLabel` already are — they
  read context optionally and fall back to react-i18next's global instance, and
  never throw. The `catch` bought nothing and cost correctness: a throw _after_
  the hook ran desyncs hook order on the next render, because React matches hooks
  positionally. objectui#2595/#2596 fixed exactly this in `@object-ui/i18n`'s
  `createSafeTranslation`; nine plugin-local re-implementations kept their own
  copy of the bug, and two more (`ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectView`) were found by the
  new lint rule below — `ObjectView` had even suppressed
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` inline to keep it.

  - Six exact re-implementations now delegate to `createSafeTranslation`:
    `plugin-detail`, `plugin-timeline`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-calendar`,
    `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid`, `plugin-designer`.
  - `components`' `data-table` also delegates; `createSafeTranslation` now
    returns `language` alongside `t` so consumers that localize dates don't need
    a second hook call. Purely additive.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-grid`'s `ImportWizard` keep their local hooks —
    they fall back _per key_, which a single-probe factory cannot express and
    which their comments justify (a host dictionary that covers common keys but
    lags on newer ones). Only the `try`/`catch` is removed.
  - `ObjectTimeline` and `ObjectView` call the hook directly and probe the
    returned value, mirroring `useSafeFieldLabel`.

  Adds `object-ui/no-try-catch-around-hook` (error) so a twelfth copy fails CI.
  It only matches `use*` names, accepts member calls solely on `React` (so
  `vi.useRealTimers()` is not a hook), and resets its try-depth inside nested
  functions (so `renderHook(() => useThing())` inside a `try` is fine) — both
  false positives were real code in this repo and are pinned in the rule's tests.

  `eslint-rules/**/*.test.js` matched no vitest project glob, so the local
  plugin's specs had never run in CI. They are now included; all three pass.

  `ObjectTimeline`'s test mock of `@object-ui/react` omitted `useObjectLabel` —
  the removed `try`/`catch` had been silently absorbing that gap. The mock is now
  complete.

- 8aae006: fix(views): the five per-view-type configs speak the spec vocabulary (#2231 phase 3)

  `kanban`/`calendar`/`gantt`/`gallery`/`timeline` on `ListViewSchema` were the last
  hand-written forks left after #2882 — and the fork was not cosmetic: objectui named
  the same concepts differently from `@objectstack/spec/ui`, and several read-sites
  only understood one of the two dialects. Two of those gaps were live bugs.

  **Kanban lanes ignored the spec key.** `ListView` gated the Kanban tab on
  `groupByField || groupField` but rendered lanes off `groupField` alone. A config
  authored with the spec key — which is exactly what the product's own
  `CreateViewDialog` emits — offered the tab and then grouped by whatever
  `detectStatusField()` guessed. The spec's `columns` (the fields shown on each card)
  was also spread onto the board verbatim, where `columns` means _lanes_, so
  `ObjectKanban` built lanes with `undefined` id and title. `columns` now maps to
  `cardFields` and the vocabulary keys are stripped from the passthrough.

  **Timeline lost every spec key in app-shell.** `ObjectView`'s `timeline` branch was
  a three-key whitelist while its `gallery`/`gantt` siblings had already been fixed to
  spread-first, so a stored `timeline: { startDateField, endDateField, groupByField,
colorField, scale }` arrived with only `titleField` and an axis pinned to the
  `'due_date'` fallback.

  Also: `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` now reads `gallery.coverField` and
  `timeline.startDateField` (it only understood the legacy aliases), and the dead
  `gallery.subtitleField` is removed — three producers computed it and `ObjectGallery`
  never read it.

  The schema side now derives from the spec configs (`.partial()`, since the product
  authors partial configs and spec marks `columns`/`titleField`/`startDateField`
  required). `gantt` needed no local schema at all. The pre-#2231 names
  (`groupField`, `cardFields`, `imageField`, `dateField`) remain accepted as deprecated
  aliases so stored views keep validating; the spec key wins wherever both appear.
  `calendar.defaultView` stays local — it has no spec counterpart.

## 16.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 7cf4051: chore(deps): align every `@objectstack/*` dependency to `^16.0.0-rc.0`

  Bumps `@objectstack/spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` from `^15.1.1` to the
  `16.0.0-rc.0` pre-release across the workspace (root + `apps/console` +
  `apps/site` + all consuming packages). ObjectUI's own packages are already on
  major 16, so this closes the 15↔16 skew between ObjectUI and the `@objectstack`
  contract libraries (which publish in lockstep with `spec`).

  This is a dependency alignment, not a behavioral migration: the full workspace
  build (43/43) and the `@objectstack`-consuming package test suites
  (`core` / `app-shell` / `data-objectstack` / `plugin-form` / `types`) are green
  against `16.0.0-rc.0` with no source changes required.

  Practical effect: `@objectstack/client@16.0.0-rc.0` now ships
  `data.batchTransaction` (framework #3271), so `ObjectStackAdapter`'s feature
  detect (`typeof client.data.batchTransaction === 'function'`) routes
  master-detail cross-object saves through the typed SDK method instead of the
  raw `fetch('/api/v1/batch')` fallback — realizing the "verify SDK path" half of
  #2694. The raw-fetch branch stays as a defensive fallback (removal tracked in
  #2694).

- ebe6494: chore(lint): clear the baseline lint errors in nine more packages (objectui#2713 Wave 2)

  Second wave of the #2713 lint-gate restoration (after #2730). These nine package
  lints were red at baseline on `main`, so their per-package `lint` gate could not
  catch new violations. Cleared every **error** (no behavior change; warnings out
  of scope):

  - **`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`** (`i18n`, `plugin-grid`, `plugin-view`,
    `plugin-list`) — translation helpers (`useSafeFieldLabel`,
    `useRowActionTranslation`, `useViewLabel`, `useViewTabLabel`, `useMoreLabel`)
    wrapped a provider-safe hook (`useObjectTranslation`/`useObjectLabel`, which
    never throw) in try/catch; removed the wrapper (the same fix #2709 applied in
    fields). `plugin-kanban` `ObjectKanban` moved its `if (error)` early return
    below the `useCallback` so hooks run unconditionally. `collaboration`
    `__unsafe_usePresenceContext` keeps its deliberate danger-prefix name via a
    justified scoped disable.
  - **`react-hooks/static-components`** (`layout`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-report`)
    — dynamic-icon / registry lookups (`resolveIcon`, `useRegistryComponent`) are
    stable component references, not components created during render → scoped
    disable with justification. `plugin-charts` `TreemapCell` was a _genuine_
    inline component and is hoisted to module scope (it is purely props-driven).
  - **`no-irregular-whitespace`** (`plugin-grid` `ImportWizard`) — the literal
    U+FEFF BOM prepended to exported CSV/text blobs (so Excel detects UTF-8) is
    now written as the `﻿` escape: byte-identical at runtime, no literal
    irregular-whitespace character in source.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`plugin-grid` `BulkActionDialog`) — dropped a
    dead `= null` initializer that the exhaustive `switch` (incl. `default`)
    overwrites before it is read.
  - **`no-unsafe-function-type`** (`plugin-view` `ViewTabBar`) — the dnd-kit
    render-prop `listeners` map is typed `Record<string, (...args: any[]) => void>`
    instead of bare `Function`.
  - **`no-require-imports`** (`plugin-kanban`, `plugin-view` tests) — hoisted
    `vi.mock` factories use an `async` factory with `await import('react')`.

### Minor Changes

- dea65f7: Unify the list-view conditional tier onto the canonical CEL engine (#1584).

  Conditional formatting (list / grid / kanban) and row-action `visible` /
  `disabled` predicates are now evaluated by `@objectstack/formula`'s
  `ExpressionEngine` — the same engine the server uses — instead of the legacy
  JS-dialect `ExpressionEvaluator`, matching how `@objectstack/spec` already types
  these surfaces (`ExpressionInputSchema` / CEL). The whole platform now speaks one
  expression dialect (framework ADR-0058).

  - `@object-ui/core`: new `evalRowPredicate` + `resolveConditionalFormatting`
    helpers (next to `evalFieldPredicate`). One implementation of all three
    formatting rule shapes; dialect routing (a `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope is
    always CEL; a bare string is CEL unless it carries legacy-only syntax
    (`${…}` / `===` / `?.` / `.includes()`), which routes to the old engine with a
    one-time deprecation warning); the native `{ field, operator, value }` form is
    translated to CEL.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `useRowPredicate` hook (canonical CEL, ambient
    predicate scope merged).
  - Consumers converged: `ListView.evaluateConditionalFormatting` (thin wrapper,
    export kept), `ObjectGrid` row styling (inline copy removed), kanban card
    styles, and the grid / data-table row-action menus. `plugin-view`'s kanban
    branch now forwards top-level `conditionalFormatting` (previously dropped).
  - Row-action `visible` fails **closed** (broken predicate → hidden + warn);
    `disabled` fails soft. The CEL `in` operator (and list membership) now work in
    row predicates — the legacy engine could not parse them.
  - The legacy `FormField.condition: { field, equals/notEquals/in }` is retired to
    a CEL translation (back-compat preserved); `FieldDesigner` migrated to
    `visibleWhen`.

  Fully back-compat: existing conditional-formatting rules, row-action predicates,
  and form `condition` metadata keep working (translated / routed as needed).

### Patch Changes

- 05e56ca: 导出/导入模板的下载文件名与内容本地化。

  **导出文件名**:CSV/Excel/JSON 导出下载不再是 `<对象名>.<扩展名>`(如 `contracts.csv`),改为「对象显示名-视图名-时间戳.扩展名」(如 `任务-In Progress-20260714-153045.xlsx`);`exportOptions.fileNamePrefix` 配置仍优先(且作为完整前缀,不再追加视图名)。视图名与对象名重复时自动省略;`@object-ui/core` 新增 `buildExportFileName(ext, { prefix, label, objectName, viewLabel }, now?)` 与 `sanitizeFileNameBase(raw)`,ObjectGrid 与 ListView 的所有导出路径(服务端流式与前端兜底)统一走它。app-shell/plugin-view 的 ObjectView 现将当前视图的显示标签写进传给 ListView 的 schema(`label`),使导出文件名能区分同一对象的不同保存视图。

  **导入模板**:「下载模板」修复两处英文漏出——示例行的 select/多选取值改为优先取选项**显示标签**(如 `准备中`)而非 ASCII slug(`prepare`,服务端导入两者都接受);模板文件名本地化为 `{{object}}-导入模板.csv`(新增 i18n key `grid.import.templateFileName`,英文回退 `{{object}}-import-template.csv`)。

## 12.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 77a0953: Consolidate the record-surface mirror onto `@objectstack/spec/data` (objectui#2269 debt paydown).

  `plugin-view/src/recordSurface.ts` re-exports `deriveRecordSurface` / `deriveRecordFlowSurface` / `countAuthorableFields` / `RECORD_SURFACE_PAGE_THRESHOLD` + types from `@objectstack/spec/data` instead of carrying a hand-kept copy — the local mirror only existed because objectui pinned a spec (`^11.7`) predating those exports, and the pin is now `^12.2`. The objectui-local overlay-size helpers (`deriveOverlaySize` / `overlayWidthFor` / `OverlaySize`, a renderer width concern the protocol doesn't own) stay local but reuse spec's `countAuthorableFields`. `RecordSurface` widens to spec's `'page' | 'modal' | 'drawer'` (the heuristic still only emits page/drawer); `resolvePostCreateTarget`'s `surface` param accepts the wider type and treats `'modal'` like a drawer. Behavior is unchanged (mirror unit tests pass verbatim against the re-exported functions); console production build resolves the subpath import.

- 68e2d1c: Studio UX audit fixes (objectui#2285) — browser walkthrough of the Studio design surface surfaced one rendering bug and several dead-space/discoverability issues; all fixed and re-verified end to end:

  - **Bug — mobile card view showed `[object Object]` for lookup fields.** `ObjectGrid`'s narrow-viewport card layout dumped raw field values through `String(value)` instead of reusing the type-aware cell renderer the desktop table already used; a lookup's expanded object (`{ id, name }`) rendered as the literal string. Now routed through the shared `coerceToSafeValue` helper (newly exported from `@object-ui/fields`, alongside `pickRecordDisplayName`) and a hoisted `renderRecordDetail`, matching the desktop path.
  - **Studio has no responsive/mobile layout.** Below the mobile breakpoint, each pillar's rail (Objects / Flows / Nav tree / Permission sets) now collapses into a toggleable overlay drawer instead of permanently squeezing the canvas into ~190px, and the top pillar-tab bar scrolls horizontally instead of clipping Automations/Interfaces/Access off-screen.
  - **Records tab / Automations canvas had a dead space band.** `ObjectView`'s built-in "+ New" toolbar row (a separate, mostly-empty flex row above the grid) is now folded into the grid's own toolbar via a new optional `onAddRecord` passthrough on `renderListView`; the Automations canvas container now sizes to the pillar's full height instead of its own intrinsic content height.
  - **Automations "fit view" never actually zoomed in.** `fitToView`'s zoom calculation was hard-capped at 100%, so small (2-4 node) flows stayed stranded in a corner of a mostly-blank canvas even after fitting. Removed the artificial cap (now bounded only by the existing `MAX_ZOOM`) and auto-fit once on mount so opening a flow starts appropriately zoomed instead of a fixed 100%/pan-0,0 default.
  - **Validations tab didn't default-select the first rule**, unlike the Access pillar's Permission Set list — now consistent.
  - **HTML/React "source" pages left the Properties panel permanently empty** (no selectable block exists for raw JSX/HTML pages). It now shows a contextual message pointing at the source editor instead of the generic "click a block" empty state.
  - **Permission matrix column headers (C/R/U/D/Tr/Re/Pu/VA/MA) had no visible legend** — added one above the matrix (the header cells' native tooltips stay as-is).
  - **App Builder landing page** widened and given the same icon-badge treatment as Home's app cards, with a 3-column grid on wide screens instead of a narrow fixed-width column stranded in the corner of the viewport.

## 11.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c1ad9e: Record task flows open as derived overlays with lossless return (framework#2604, extends framework#2578).

  - **Create/Edit never route** — the global record form is URL-driven (`?form=new` / `?form=<id>`): browser Back closes the overlay with the origin (list scroll/filters, detail state) intact; field-heavy objects derive a full-screen modal (`modalSize:'full'`) via the new `deriveRecordFlowSurface` mirror in plugin-view, light ones keep the auto-sized modal. `editMode:'page'` opt-in unchanged.
  - **Save invariant** — _edit never moves you_ (origin refetches in place); _create lands on the new record's detail_ on its derived surface (drawer over the still-intact list for light objects, detail route for heavy), with `replace:true` so Back skips the transient form entry.
  - **Subtable child create/edit = overlay over the parent detail, never a route** — related-list New/Edit push `?form=…&formObject=<child>&formLink=<fk>:<parentId>`; the one global overlay pre-links the parent (refresh-safe), sizes to the CHILD object, and on save stays on the parent while only the child's related lists refetch. ModalForm now forwards `initialValues` into its master-detail (subforms) branch so pre-links survive for children with inline line items.

### Patch Changes

- 70c4a3f: Studio package-create dogfood follow-ups (framework#2615 — P2 wizard + P3 polish):

  - **Package-id wizard feedback.** The three package wizards (switcher create,
    landing create, landing duplicate) share a new `PackageIdInput`: illegal
    characters are still normalized away, but no longer silently — a notice
    says what was removed — a reverse-domain format hint shows while the id
    doesn't parse, and a CJK-only name that yields no id suggestion is told to
    type one manually instead of leaving the id box mysteriously empty.
  - **Records-grid duplicate "Actions" column.** A field literally named
    `actions` is now dropped from the Studio grid's data columns, so it no
    longer collides with the always-pinned row-actions column (it stays
    editable in the form designer).
  - **Record-create verb consistency.** The `ObjectView` toolbar create button
    resolved a hardcoded English "Create"; it now uses the same
    `console.objectView.new` ("New" / 新建) key as the runtime object pages so
    Studio and the running app agree.
  - **Branded cold-load splash.** The console's pre-auth loading gate rendered a
    bare "Loading…"; it now shows the branded, boot-safe `LoadingScreen`.
  - **Picklist option editor.** Value/label inputs and CJK option labels no
    longer truncate — the six controls that shared one cramped row are split
    into a two-row layout so the inputs get the full panel width.
  - **Draft-save confirmation.** The Data pillar's "Save draft" now shows a
    success toast and a "last saved HH:MM" indicator, matching the App and
    Automations pillars.

## 11.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bf6295: feat: adaptive record surface + semantic field span + responsive columns (framework#2578)

  Field-heavy objects (all metadata is AI-authored) now present themselves without
  any authored presentation config:

  - **Adaptive surface** — a record's create/edit/detail opens as a full page when
    the object is field-heavy, or a drawer when it is light. Derived from field
    count (`deriveRecordSurface`), not authored; mobile always pages. Wired into the
    app-shell ObjectView detail navigation (an authored view/object `navigation`
    still wins).
  - **Semantic field span** — `FormField.span` (`auto`/`full`) is a width primitive
    decoupled from the (per-surface derived) column count; legacy `colSpan` is
    clamped so it never overflows. `ObjectForm` now honours per-section `columns`
    and carries `span`/`colSpan` from section defs — fixes the bug where
    `type:'simple'` ignored `section.columns` and grouped fields rendered single
    column.
  - **Responsive columns** — `inferColumns` scales the column CAP with field count
    (≤3→1, ≤8→2, ≤15→3, 16+→4); the ACTUAL column count follows the form's real
    width via CSS container queries, so the same form goes 1→2→3→4 columns as a
    drawer widens or becomes a page.
  - **Runtime overlay width** — `NavigationConfig.size` bucket is resolved to a
    viewport-clamped width at runtime (`overlayWidthFor`); a pixel width is never
    authored (the author cannot know the client viewport).

### Minor Changes

- 4eb9cb6: feat(plugin-tree): add a `tree` / tree-grid object view type

  Renders a self-referencing object as an indented, expand/collapse tree-grid —
  the right view for arbitrary-depth hierarchies (business unit / org chart,
  category trees, BOMs, nested comments) that fixed-depth grouping can't express.
  New `@object-ui/plugin-tree` package (`object-tree`/`tree`), `tree` added to the
  `ViewType` union, and dispatch wired through plugin-list `ListView` +
  app-shell `ObjectView` (the console path).

- 7b71cd8: Unify the runtime ObjectView "view editor" onto the studio's spec-driven inspector. The right-rail view editor now hosts the same `ViewVariantInspector` the metadata studio uses (config fields sourced straight from `@objectstack/spec`) instead of the legacy `buildViewConfigSchema` engine, so runtime and studio share one view-editing surface. A new `view-config-adapter` bridges the runtime's flat view shape and the studio's ViewItem draft, keeping the `sys_view` persistence path untouched; field pickers read from the in-memory object definition (no extra network fetch). The legacy `buildViewConfigSchema` engine and its exports are retired; `ConfigPanelRenderer` is retained for the dashboard/report config panels.

### Patch Changes

- 9bef806: feat(view): pass form-view `subforms` through to ObjectForm

  `ObjectView`'s form schema now forwards `form.subforms` to `ObjectForm`, so a
  form view that declares inline child collections renders as a master-detail
  form (parent fields + child grids, atomic save) in ObjectView's own
  create/edit form — no bespoke page. Pairs with `@objectstack/spec`
  `FormViewSchema.subforms` and ObjectForm's existing `subforms` rendering.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
