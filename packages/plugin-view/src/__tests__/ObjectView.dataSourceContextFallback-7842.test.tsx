/**
 * `ObjectViewProps.dataSource` — the type is right, the prose was wrong
 * (objectui#7842).
 *
 * The card: the JSDoc on this prop promised "If not provided, falls back to
 * SchemaRendererProvider context" one line above `dataSource: DataSource`,
 * declared REQUIRED. One of the two had been wrong for the prop's whole life,
 * and which one is a MEASUREMENT, not a preference — because the two answers
 * lead opposite ways. "The type is right" is a comment deletion. "The JSDoc is
 * right" would make a required published prop optional, which WIDENS a
 * published accept set and is a maintainer's ruling.
 *
 * The measurement is the type's: `ObjectView` holds no context read at all.
 * This file pins it from both sides, because the interesting half is a
 * NEGATIVE — "the adapter in context is never touched" — and a negative
 * asserted by itself is indistinguishable from a harness that could not have
 * observed the call in the first place. So the live control comes first: the
 * same probe, the same wait, an adapter passed as the prop, and the read DOES
 * happen. Only then does the absence of that read mean anything.
 *
 * ## Why this file does NOT stub `SchemaRendererContext`
 *
 * Every sibling `ObjectView.*.test.tsx` mocks `@object-ui/react` and replaces
 * `SchemaRendererContext` with a fresh `React.createContext(null)`. That is
 * fine for them and would be a FALSE GREEN here: a future fallback would be
 * written with the real context (directly, or through `useElementDataSource`,
 * which is how `@object-ui/react` spells this fallback for the components that
 * do have one), and a provider built on a look-alike context object cannot be
 * seen by it. This file therefore keeps the REAL `SchemaRendererProvider` and
 * the REAL context, and stubs only `SchemaRenderer` — the heavy renderer the
 * non-grid branch delegates to, which is not what is under test.
 *
 * ## Direction
 *
 * Section 1 was GREEN before the JSDoc deletion and is GREEN after: it pins
 * the behaviour the deletion described, not the deletion. Section 2 pins where
 * the deleted sentence was actually TRUE — `ObjectViewRenderer`, the renderer
 * registered for the `object-view` and `view` schema tags, really does resolve
 * `dataSource` from this context. The sentence was misfiled, not invented, and
 * a reader who finds only section 1 would be entitled to re-add it.
