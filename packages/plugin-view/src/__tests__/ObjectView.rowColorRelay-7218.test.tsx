/**
 * objectui#7218 — the object-view host relays the active view's `rowColor`.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `rowColor` is a declared member of `ListViewSchema` (imported by reference
 * from `@objectstack/spec`'s `ListViewSchema`, shape `{ field, colors? }`), and
 * `ListView` READS it: `ListView.tsx` seeds `rowColorConfig` state from
 * `schema.rowColor` and hands it to the grid, which colours whole rows from a
 * field value. The delegation branch below relays 46 keys off the active view
 * and `rowColor` had NO rung, so an authored per-view row colour could not
 * reach the renderer through this host at all.
 *
 * It is the "declared and inert" shape — the same one objectui#7199 fixed for
 * `description`: nothing errors, every authoring gate passes, the API serves
 * the value, and the only symptom is that the rows are not coloured. An author
 * has no way to notice short of diffing the DOM.
 *
 * ## Why this is a relay and not an intent question
 *
 * A sibling host already ships the key with no fence:
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/InterfaceListPage.tsx` relays
 * `rowColor: view.rowColor` alongside `grouping` and `pagination` into a
 * schema typed `ListViewSchema`. So `rowColor` is demonstrably author-reachable
 * on the interface route already; the object-view route simply did not use the
 * delivery path. The rung added here copies that precedent verbatim.
 *
 * The legacy shorthand for the same feature — bare `color`, which
 * `list-view-spec-parity` records as "legacy row/text coloring shorthand
 * (spec-canonical: `rowColor`)" — was ALREADY relayed by this literal. Only the
 * spec-canonical spelling was missing.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The rung is view-sourced ONLY, and that is load-bearing
 *
 * The relay reads `activeView?.rowColor` and deliberately does NOT fall back to
 * `(schema as any).rowColor`. A cast read off the object-view NODE would add a
 * 28th key to the objectui#5097 HOST-COMPOSITION exemption — the maintainer
 * ruling of 2026-08-18 that fixed that set at 27 — and that is a ruling, not a
 * refactor. The last case in this file pins the narrowness so the shortcut
 * cannot be taken later without a test going red and naming the ledger.
 *
 * `grouping: activeView?.grouping` is the in-fence precedent for a view-only
 * rung carrying no cast read, and it is the control used below.
 *
 * ## Direction, written before the run (reverse verification)
 *
 * Deleting the `rowColor:` rung was PREDICTED to turn the two FIX cases RED
 * (`captured.rowColor` `undefined`) and to leave the three controls GREEN — the
 * `grouping` control rides its own untouched rung, and the two absence cases
 * assert `undefined`, which is what a missing rung produces. Predicted 2 red /
 * 3 passing. Measured outcome is recorded on the PR.
