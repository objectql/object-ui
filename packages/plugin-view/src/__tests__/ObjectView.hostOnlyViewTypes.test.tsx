/**
 * The BASIS of the objectui#5321 exemption, measured — plus the one behaviour
 * the card changed.
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 *
 * The maintainer ruled on 2026-08-20 that `tree` and `chart` stay
 * HOST-COMPOSITION-ONLY view types: recorded, not added to
 * `ObjectViewSchema.defaultViewType` / `NamedListView.type`. That record lives
 * in `OBJECT_VIEW_HOST_COMPOSITION_VIEW_TYPES` (ObjectView.tsx) and is pinned
 * by `objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx`.
 *
 * An exemption of that shape is a claim about REACHABILITY — "an author cannot
 * select these, a host still can" — so the second half has to keep being
 * measured or the record quietly becomes a statement about nothing. That is
 * this file: a host `views` prop still drives `generateViewSchema` into both
 * branches, and both still emit their renderer schema.
 *
 * ## Why the other half is NOT tested here
 *
 * There is deliberately no "an author cannot reach it" runtime test. Types are
 * erased before this suite runs, so a schema with `defaultViewType: 'tree'`
 * force-cast past the compiler WOULD reach the branch at runtime — a test
 * asserting otherwise could only pass by testing something else. The authored
 * half is a compile-time claim and is pinned where it can actually fail: the
 * type-level assertions in `objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx`, which go red under
 * `pnpm --filter @object-ui/plugin-view type-check` the day either union grows
 * a `tree` or `chart` member.
 *
 * ## The behaviour the card changed
 *
 * `viewSwitcherSchema`'s `iconMap` had a `chart` key (added by objectui#2916)
 * and no `tree` one, so a host-supplied tree view fell through to the
 * `'table'` fallback and was labelled with the GRID icon. The console reaches
 * this: `CreateViewDialog` offers `tree` among the view types a user can
 * create, and those records arrive here as the `views` prop.
