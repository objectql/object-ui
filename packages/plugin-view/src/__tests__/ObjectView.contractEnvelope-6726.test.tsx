/**
 * `ObjectView`'s non-grid fetch reads a `find()` answer as `QueryResult`
 * DECLARES it — and does NOT read `records` (objectui#6726).
 *
 * `QueryResult` (`@object-ui/types`) declares exactly one rows member: `data`.
 * This block's unwrap was a four-branch ladder — bare array, `data`, `records`,
 * `value` — and the `records` branch sat between the contract's member and the
 * OData one.
 *
 * MEASURED on this tree, no producer emits `records` at this `DataSource.find()`
 * seam: `ObjectStackAdapter.normalizeQueryResult` CONSUMES the server/SDK
 * `records` envelope and returns `{ data, total, page, pageSize, hasMore }`
 * before returning, and every other `find()` implementation in the repo returns
 * `data` or a bare array. The branch was unreachable in practice — and an
 * unreachable tolerant branch is precisely where a non-conforming producer
 * would keep working unrejected (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * OUT OF THIS CARD'S FENCE, recorded so the silence is not read as a verdict:
 * the `value` branch is a below-the-adapter spelling by the same argument, and
 * it is left standing here. objectui#6726 names `records`; `value` is filed
 * separately rather than fixed on a card that did not measure it.
 *
 * The rows reach the child as `data={data}`, so that prop is what this pin
 * reads. The `data` and bare-array legs push the SAME rows through the SAME
 * mount, which is what makes the `records` leg a reading rather than a mount
 * that never rendered.

/**
 * Mount the view over a `find()` that answers with `envelope`, and return the
 * LAST row array the child was handed.
 *
 * ⛔ Call this ONCE per case, and NEVER from inside a `waitFor` predicate
 * (objectui#7802). It renders, and `waitFor` re-runs its callback on DOM
 * MUTATIONS as well as on its interval, so a predicate that renders schedules
 * its own next run — self-feeding — and every run leaks the container div
 * `render` appends to `document.body` (RTL's `unmount()` tears down the React
 * root but leaves that div behind). Measured on THIS helper with `interval`
 * pinned AT `timeout`, so the interval timer can never re-run the callback:
 *
 *   sync predicate rendering into the document .. 200 runs / 191ms, growth 200
 *   sync predicate rendering into a DETACHED div ... 1 run / 2006ms, growth 0
 *   inert predicate ................................ 1 run / 2002ms, growth 0
 *
 * 200 where the interval permitted one — objectui#7756's worker-killing shape.
 *
 * An `async` predicate happened to be spared: `wait-for.js`'s `checkCallback`
 * early-returns while `promiseStatus === 'pending'`, so a DOM mutation cannot
 * re-enter a predicate still in flight. Same measurement, async shape: 1 run
 * pinned, 19 runs at the default 50ms cadence, `document.body` growth equal to
 * the run count either way.
 *
 * ⚠️ That early return is RTL's IMPLEMENTATION, not its contract. It made the
 * leak BOUNDED by accident, and dropping the `async` removes the only thing
 * holding it — measured: the synchronous form of the call below reported no
 * tests at all and had to be killed at a 480s wall, where the file otherwise
 * passes in under two seconds. So the render lives out here, once, and the
 * cases assert on its answer directly.
