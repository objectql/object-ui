### Patch Changes

- a7e39a8: `ChartContainer`'s min-size fallback survives a consumer-supplied `style` (objectstack#7026)

  The container wrote `style={{ minHeight: 280, minWidth: 0, ...props.style }}` and
  then spread `{...props}` on the line BELOW it. `props` is the rest of
  `ComponentProps< "div" >` — only `id`, `className`, `children`, `config` and
  `disableSettleRemount` are destructured out of it — so it still carried the
  consumer's `style`, and a later JSX attribute of the same name replaces an earlier
  one outright. Any caller that passed a `style` therefore replaced the whole object:
  both `minHeight` and `minWidth` vanished, and the `...props.style` merge written
  inside it never executed even once. It was dead code that read, to anyone auditing
  the file, as if the fallback were guaranteed.

  That fallback is not decorative. It exists so Recharts' `ResponsiveContainer`
  always has a non-zero box to measure: a dashboard widget that overrides the
  container's `h-[350px]` class and wraps the chart in flex/grid without an explicit
  child height leaves the box at 0, Recharts measures `width/height = -1`, and the
  chart renders invisibly — the exact failure the guard was added for.

  `style` is now destructured out of the rest props and merged explicitly, so which
  side wins is stated in code instead of being decided by JSX attribute order, and
  `{...props}` can no longer reach `style` at all.

  Precedence: **an author's explicit size wins.** Simply spreading `{...props}`
  first and merging unconditionally would have traded this bug for its mirror image
  — `minHeight: 280` injected next to an authored `height: 100` floors that 100 to
  280, silently overriding the author. So each half of the fallback applies only
  when the consumer style declares neither of its own keys: `height`/`minHeight`
  gate the height half, `width`/`minWidth` gate the width half, and a key present
  but set to `undefined`/`null` counts as not declared. Every other consumer style
  key passes through untouched.

  Behaviour change surface, deliberately narrow. A caller that supplies no `style`
  is byte-for-byte unchanged. A caller whose `style` declares a height — which today
  is the only shape in the tree, `AdvancedChartImpl`'s `containerProps` forwarding
  `ChartConfig.height` — keeps exactly the height it authored, also unchanged, and
  additionally regains the `minWidth: 0` half. What changes is the case the issue
  was filed for: a `style` carrying no size key (a margin, a padding, an
  aspect-ratio, any future container-level presentation prop routed through the same
  `containerProps` path) now keeps the min-size fallback instead of silently
  stripping it.

  Pinned in both directions, since a one-sided pin would have been satisfied by the
  mirror-image fix: a non-size `style` keeps `min-height: 280` / `min-width: 0`
  (red before this change), and an explicit `height: 100` renders as 100 with no
  `min-height` floor (red under the unconditional-merge alternative).

- 4bc6c23: Converge dashboard widget `compareTo` on the executor's `{ kind, dimension? }` contract, and make the dataset path actually render a comparison

  `CompareToConfig` was a three-branch union (`'previousPeriod' | 'previousYear' | { offset }`). `@objectstack/spec` collapsed it to the shape the analytics executor already implements — `DatasetCompareTo`, a plain strict object `{ kind: 'previousPeriod' | 'previousYear'; dimension?: string }` (objectstack#5011) — so this renderer now reads that one shape:

  - `shiftFilterByCompareTo` / `compareToTrendLabelKey` dispatch on `compareTo.kind`. The `{ offset }` duration shift is gone: `{ offset: '1y' }` is `kind: 'previousYear'`, while `'7d'` / `'1M'` have no faithful target and are restated by the author on the widget's own `filter` plus `kind: 'previousPeriod'`. No trend label key is retired — the offset arm resolved to `vsPreviousPeriod`, which survives as the `previousPeriod` fallback.
  - `DatasetWidget` no longer discards part of `compareTo`. It used to forward only the object form because the two string forms had no meaning downstream; with one shape there is nothing to discard, and a stale string is now invalid metadata rejected where it is authored rather than silently reinterpreted here.
  - **The comparison now actually runs on the dataset path.** A widget states its window in its own `filter` (a date macro, or the dashboard date-range filter merged in), but the executor shifts a `timeDimensions` entry carrying a `dateRange` — so a dataset widget asking for a comparison got "compareTo needs a dated window to shift" and rendered none. When (and only when) a comparison is requested, the resolved filter's bounded date windows are lowered into `selection.timeDimensions[].dateRange` and moved out of `runtimeFilter` (a copy left behind would intersect the shifted window with the current one and empty every comparison column). Which dimension gets shifted stays the executor's decision: every window found is lowered under the name the author wrote, and zero or two candidates surfaces the executor's own error, listing them.
  - The `<measure>__compare` columns that come back are now shown: a delta + window label on KPI widgets, a comparison column on tables, and a `variant: 'comparison'` overlay series on charts — the same treatment and the same `dashboard.trend.*` labels the inline object-provider widgets already use.

- 5bfaabd: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches every object-bound block, not just
  `list-view` — and `element:record_picker` stops discarding `view`
  (objectstack#6953).

  objectstack#5576 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to `list-view` and left
  the same declaration inert on every other page component. Two gaps remained, and
  both were silent:

  - **`element:record_picker` read four of the five keys and dropped `view`.** So
    `dataSource: { object: 'account', view: 'hot' }` — the spec's own example —
    built a picker over EVERY account instead of the rows the saved view selects.
    Nothing threw and nothing rendered an error; the option list was simply wider
    than what was authored, which also means a user could select a record the page
    said was out of scope.
  - **`object-grid` / `object-form` / `object-kanban` / `object-calendar` /
    `object-chart` / `object-metric` / `record:related_list` read none of it.**
    Each gates its fetch on its own `objectName`, and nothing mapped
    `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page written the way the spec documents
    rendered an empty grid / a field-less form / a board with no cards / an empty
    month / an empty chart / a static metric number — with no request and no
    diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
    objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged on every block:
  a named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error instead of
  degrading to the object's full scope.

  - `@object-ui/react` — new `useElementDataSourceSchema(schema, mapping, dataSource?)`
    and `ElementDataSourceGate` apply a resolved binding to the schema keys a given
    block reads, plus `ElementDataSourceErrorPanel` / `ElementDataSourceLoadingPanel`
    for the two non-final states. One precedence table for all blocks rather than
    one copy per block — that copy is how "additional filter criteria" would have
    become two dialects.
  - A mapping names **only** keys its block genuinely reads. A composed value
    written onto a key the block ignores would be accepted and dropped, which is
    the defect being removed, one layer deeper — so a kanban's swimlane `columns`
    never receive a view's field list, and a block with no row cap leaves `limit`
    unmapped. The per-block coverage table, including two residual gaps that are
    named rather than papered over, is in `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour changes for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

### Minor Changes

- 9e9e9a9: `DrillDownConfig` now declares only keys a renderer reads, and `target: 'navigate'` is honoured on charts too (#3354).

  **Removed — two keys no renderer has ever read.** `DrillDownConfig.view` (self-described as "reserved") and `DrillDownConfig.sort` ("default sort applied to the drill list") had zero read sites repo-wide: the drill drawer rendered its inline `object-data-table` regardless of `view`, and no widget put `sort` into the drilled table schema. Authoring either did nothing, silently. They are removed rather than implemented because nothing asked for them, and this interface is the shape the protocol's own `drillDown` declaration is being derived from (objectstack#5022) — left in place, they were about to become dead keys carrying protocol authority. Removing a declared key from a published interface is technically breaking for anyone who wrote one, but only in the sense that TypeScript now reports what was already true at runtime: the key did nothing. Per this repo's version policy the bump stays `minor` (the fixed release group tracks `@objectstack`'s major). A compile-time pin in `@object-ui/types` keeps both keys from drifting back without a reader.

  **Fixed — `ObjectChart` no longer degrades `target: 'navigate'` to a drawer.** All five widgets share `DrillDownConfig`, whose `target` JSDoc promises `'navigate'` skips the in-place view and opens the object's full list page when the host provides drill navigation. `DrillDownDrawer` delivered that for the table / pivot / metric widgets, but `ObjectChart` draws its own drawer and branched on `'dialog'` only — so `'navigate'` fell through to the default side sheet, indistinguishable from `'drawer'` even with a host handler wired. The chart now routes `'navigate'` through `DrillNavigationContext.openRecordList` with the same merged filter the drawer would have used, and keeps the documented fallback: with no host navigation handler it degrades to the drawer. `'drawer'` / `'dialog'` behaviour is unchanged, and the header's "Open in list" escape hatch stays independent of `target`.

  The `object-chart` registry input deliberately keeps advertising `target: 'drawer' | 'dialog'` only. `ChartDrillDownSchema` in `@objectstack/spec` declares the chart drill target as those two, strictly, and the publish-time react-page lint parses that schema against the authored literal — so listing `'navigate'` in the designer palette would offer authors a value the publish gate rejects. Widening the protocol union is a spec-side follow-up (objectstack#5435); `'navigate'` works today for any host that composes an `object-chart` schema directly.

- 524a635: `<ObjectChart>` declares `drillDown` as a registry input, so the SDUI save gate treats the segment drill as a contract prop instead of an unknown one (framework#5022).

  The component has read `schema.drillDown` all along — it is what opens the drawer of underlying records when you click a bar or a slice — but the prop was declared in neither the protocol nor this registry entry. The manifest the save gate validates page JSX against is built verbatim from these `inputs`, so an author who wrote the drill got an `unknown-prop` diagnostic for a prop that works. `@objectstack/spec` now declares the shape (`ChartDrillDownSchema`, published on the react-tier `<ObjectChart>` contract); this is the renderer half.

  The published input describes the six keys the spec declares — `enabled`, `filter`, `title`, `target` (`'drawer' | 'dialog'`), `columns`, `maxRows` — and deliberately not the wider `DrillDownConfig` this repo shares with the table / pivot / metric widgets: `ObjectChart` reads none of `mode` / `report` / `view` / `sort`, and does not implement `target: 'navigate'` (it renders the drawer instead — objectui#3354).

  The untyped `(schema as any).drillDown` read is now typed as `DrillDownConfig`. Narrowing it to the spec's `ChartDrillDown` is left as a TODO on the version pin: `@objectstack/spec` is pinned at `^17.0.0-rc.2` here and the declaration lands in the next rc, and re-declaring the shape locally would be the fork that lets the two drift.

### Minor Changes

- 4a51e77: Stop declaring 14 symbols across ten packages under names `@objectstack/spec`
  owns (objectui#3161, objectstack#4115 batch 7 — the long tail, one or two
  entries per package). All ten packages leave the ledger, which drops from 17
  collisions across 11 packages to 3 across 1.

  **Renamed exports** — in every case the spec exports the same name for a
  _different_ thing, so the old name was a mis-description rather than a dialect:

  | package                    | was                                | now                                                  | what the spec's same-named export is                                                                                                       |
  | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@object-ui/fields`        | `FieldWidgetProps`                 | `FieldWidgetComponentProps`                          | the DECLARED field-widget plugin props contract (a zod object; `field.type` is the `FieldType` enum, `readonly`/`required` carry defaults) |
  | `@object-ui/layout`        | `PageHeaderProps`                  | `PageHeaderComponentProps`                           | the authored `page:header` node — a zod schema of `title`, `subtitle`, an icon NAME, `breadcrumb`, `actions: string[]`                     |
  | `@object-ui/layout`        | `Page`                             | `PageNodeRenderer`                                   | the authored page metadata DOCUMENT (`name`, `label`, `type`, `regions`)                                                                   |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-detail` | `ObjectFieldLike`                  | `ObjectDefFieldLike`                                 | the i18n duck type `translateObject` walks (`help`/`description`, plus `[key: string]: any`)                                               |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid`   | `ColumnSummaryConfig`              | `ColumnSummarySetting`                               | the OBJECT form of `ListColumn.summary` **only** — the local one was the whole union, shorthand included                                   |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid`   | `isMultiValueField`                | `hasMultiValueShape`                                 | the spec's classifier, which requires a def with a `type`; the local one is called with `undefined`                                        |
  | `@object-ui/collaboration` | `RealtimeConfig`                   | `RealtimeSubscriptionConfig`                         | the app's realtime DECLARATION (`enabled`, `transport`, `subscriptions[]`)                                                                 |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-charts` | `ChartConfig`                      | `ChartContainerConfig`                               | the authored chart document (`type`, `xAxis`, `series`, `showLegend`, …)                                                                   |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-form`   | `FormSection` / `FormSectionProps` | `FormSectionContainer` / `FormSectionContainerProps` | the authored form-section metadata (`name`, `pane`, `visibleWhen`, `fields`)                                                               |
  | `@object-ui/providers`     | `Theme`                            | `ThemePreference`                                    | a whole theme DOCUMENT (`name`, `label`, `colors`, `typography`)                                                                           |
  | `@object-ui/runner`        | `App` (default export)             | `RunnerApp`                                          | the authored application metadata type **and** the `App.create()` builder                                                                  |
  | `@object-ui/sdui-parser`   | `ValidationResult`                 | `ManifestValidationResult`                           | plugin-manifest validation (`{ valid, errors?, warnings? }`), exported from both `kernel` and `contracts`                                  |

  `ManifestValidationResult` follows the `<what was validated>Validation<Error|Result>`
  convention registered on objectstack#4115 (`@object-ui/core` took
  `SchemaNodeValidationResult` in batch 4). `PageHeaderComponentProps` deliberately
  reuses the name `@object-ui/app-shell` already chose for its own header props in
  batch 3, so one concept does not acquire two dialect names one package apart.

  **Now derived from the spec instead of hand-written:**

  - `@object-ui/fields` — `isFileIdToken` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`. The local copy was character-for-character identical
    to the spec's function while its comment said it "mirrors" it, so every
    behaviour test passed and only reference identity could tell the two apart.
    The regex is a wire decision: widening it server-side while a copy here kept
    the old bound would make every new id read as "not a reference", and the
    widget would submit the legacy inline blob to a backend expecting a reference.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `FeedFilterMode` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`, in a file that already imported the sibling
    `FeedItemType` from the spec.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid` — the eleven-member aggregation union is now the
    spec's `ColumnSummary` enum, so the total `Record<ColumnSummaryType, string>`
    label map turns a member the spec adds into a compile error instead of a
    blank footer cell. `ColumnSummarySetting` is `NonNullable<ListColumn['summary']>`,
    i.e. whatever forms the spec itself accepts. `hasMultiValueShape` delegates to
    the spec's `isMultiValueField` rather than re-deriving it from
    `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES` / `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES`.
  - `@object-ui/providers` — `ThemePreference` is the spec's `ThemeMode` union
    plus the one legacy `'system'` spelling this provider still honours for stored
    preferences, read off the schema's own `_zod` carrier so the package takes no
    zod dependency.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/fields` (it re-exports a runtime function) and `@object-ui/providers`
  (its public `.d.ts` now references the spec).

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

### Minor Changes

- f1c04b6: fix(charts): a spec `series[].type` override actually draws, and a spec-shape `series` plots at all (#2945)

  #2945 listed `combo` (`plugin-charts`) as renderer-local dialect to "promote or
  delete". Neither: the spec **already models a combo chart**, per-series, and its
  own field comment says so —

  ```ts
  // spec/src/ui/chart.zod.ts — ChartSeriesSchema
  /** Series type override (combo charts) */
  type: ChartTypeSchema.optional().describe('Override chart type for this series'),
  ```

  — exactly as it models stacking with `ChartSeries.stack` rather than a
  `stacked-bar` family. So `combo` is not a name an author should reach for; it is
  what "the series disagree about their family" looks like from the renderer's
  side. `effectiveChartFamily` now derives it, and `combo` stays a documented
  renderer-local marker (internal callers pass it directly today).

  Chasing that turned up two live bugs, both silent, on the path a spec author
  takes.

  **1. The per-series override was parsed, carried, and then dropped.** Only the
  renderer's `chartType === 'combo'` branch read `series[].chartType`, so

  ```ts
  { type: 'bar', series: [{ name: 'revenue' }, { name: 'margin', type: 'line' }] }
  ```

  drew `margin` as a bar. Nothing was wrong at any layer but the last — a unit test
  even asserted the value was carried.

  **2. A spec-shape `series` rendered nothing at all.** `series` is the one binding
  both shapes spell with the same key, so `ChartRenderer`'s blanket "internal props
  win" rule let the author's `[{ name }]` shadow the normalized `[{ dataKey }]` and
  reach a renderer that reads `dataKey`. Blank chart. Every other spec binding has a
  distinct name (`xAxis` vs `xAxisKey`), which is why only this one broke — and why
  the isolated normalization tests all passed over a dead path. The raw array is now
  preferred only when it already speaks the internal shape, so internal callers are
  byte-for-byte unchanged and a mixed array works too.

  **Also fixed in passing:** the combo branch had an `area` arm under a `BarChart`
  container, and Recharts renders an `<Area>` child of `BarChart` as nothing — so an
  authored combo with an `area` series drew a blank series. The container is now
  `ComposedChart`, which is what Recharts provides for mixed marks.

  Widening only. A chart whose series all resolve to one family keeps its own
  family, an explicit `combo` is untouched, and a family with no per-series meaning
  (`pie`, `horizontal-bar`, …) is never widened. A derived combo binds series to the
  left axis unless one asks for `yAxis: 'right'` — the spec's own default — so
  widening changes the series' mark and not its scale; the legacy bar→left/line→right
  guess is kept for an authored `combo`, where it was historically the only way to
  reach a second axis.

  Guards: `effectiveChartFamily` / `comboBaseFamily` are unit-tested over the whole
  family matrix; DOM-level tests assert the **marks** rather than the derived family,
  since the carry was already covered and the drawing was what broke; and
  `spec-derived-unions.test.ts` asserts `combo` is absent from the spec's
  `ChartTypeSchema`, so the day it is adopted upstream the derivation is named as the
  thing to retire.

## 17.0.0

### Minor Changes

- aa88056: feat(charts): honor `ChartAxis.stepSize`, `ChartConfig.description` and `ChartConfig.height` (framework#3752)

  The tail of the declared-≠-delivered sweep from framework#3729 / #2880. Three
  `ChartConfig` props reached the renderer and did nothing:

  - **`ChartAxis.stepSize`** — Recharts has no "a tick every N units" prop
    (`tickCount` is a hint it may ignore, `interval` is for categorical axes), so
    honoring a step means handing it the tick array outright. `ticksFor` builds it
    from the axis's own `min`/`max` where declared and from the plotted values
    otherwise, so a step works with or without a pinned domain. A data-derived max
    rounds UP to the next step (otherwise the topmost bar sits above the last
    gridline and the axis reads as truncated); an explicit `max` clamps instead,
    since a tick outside a pinned domain would be drawn outside the plot. A step
    that would produce more than 200 ticks is refused rather than rendered — that
    is a wrong config, and drawing it would hang the page instead of surfacing the
    mistake.
  - **`ChartConfig.description`** — the accessibility description. A chart is a
    picture to a screen reader; the container now carries `role="img"` +
    `aria-label`. Without a description it stays an ordinary div, because
    stamping `role="img"` on an _unlabelled_ graphic is worse than leaving one a
    screen reader can skip.
  - **`ChartConfig.height`** — was read only by the legacy `ChartBarRenderer`, not
    by the advanced path that draws every real chart. Now applied to the chart
    container as an inline style, which beats its default `h-[350px]` class.

  `height` and `description` ride on the shared container props, so they apply to
  all eight chart families rather than one branch.

- 9b53d72: feat(charts): ObjectChart honors the spec `ChartConfig` author shape (objectui#2880 / framework#3729)

  `ChartConfigSchema` is the chart protocol, but the renderer only ever read a
  Recharts-flavoured internal shape — `chartType`, `xAxisKey`, `series[].dataKey`.
  Everything an author wrote in the SPEC shape reached the renderer and was
  silently dropped, which is exactly what ADR-0078 forbids. framework#3725
  documented the gap by trimming the published contract down to the props that
  actually worked; this closes it the other way round.

  **S1 — one normalization boundary.** `normalizeChartSchema` translates the
  author shape into the internal pipeline contract in a single place, rather than
  scattering `??` fallbacks through the render tree (framework PD #12: one
  translation is a contract mapping, N fallbacks are a second dialect):

  - `type` → `chartType`, `xAxis: { field }` → `xAxisKey`, `series: [{ name }]` →
    `series: [{ dataKey }]`
  - the report surface's bare-string `xAxis`/`yAxis` resolve too
  - `yAxis: [{ field }]` alone plots, with no `series` declared
  - **internal props win**, so `DashboardRenderer`, `ObjectView` and the dataset
    path are byte-for-byte unaffected — there is no migration

  **The `type` collision.** `ChartConfig.type` is the chart family, but on any
  surface that flattens chart config into a props bag `type` is already the SDUI
  envelope's component discriminator. Spreading props last let an author's
  `type="bar"` replace `object-chart` so the block stopped resolving; stamping the
  discriminator last ate the author's value instead. The react-page wrapper now
  keeps both: the discriminator wins the `type` slot and the author's value is
  preserved beside it as `specType`, which the normalizer reads back.

  **S2 — axis presentation.** `ChartAxis.format` drives the tick formatter (via
  `Intl.NumberFormat`, no new dependency), `min`/`max` pin the domain,
  `logarithmic` swaps the scale, `title` labels the axis, and `showGridLines` is
  honored. A second `yAxis` entry (or `position: 'right'`) turns on the secondary
  axis that `series[].yAxis` binds to — in combo charts an explicit binding now
  beats the family-derived bar→left/line→right guess. `showLegend` is honored,
  and `title`/`subtitle` render above the plot instead of only titling the
  drill-down drawer.

  **S3 — `series[].stack`, `annotations`, `interaction`.** Stacking passes the
  author's group name through as Recharts' `stackId`. Annotations render as
  `ReferenceLine` (`type: 'line'`) / `ReferenceArea` (`type: 'region'`) with the
  declared axis, colour, style and label. `interaction.tooltips: false` suppresses
  the hover card and `interaction.brush: true` adds the range selector;
  `showDataLabels` prints values on the marks. `interaction.zoom` has no Recharts
  primitive behind it and is deliberately still unimplemented rather than faked.

### Patch Changes

- 7b35e4b: fix(dashboard,charts): resolve `{current_user_id}` in widget filters (framework #3574)

  A dashboard widget filtered on `{current_user_id}` rendered `0`. The token
  reached SQL as a literal, matched no row, and nothing was logged on the client
  or the server — a silent zero that reads as "you have no work" rather than
  "this filter did not resolve". The same token in a list-view filter resolved
  correctly, so a user-scoped list and a user-scoped widget over the same data
  disagreed.

  There was no shared resolver. Three ad-hoc implementations had grown up
  independently — `ObjectView` for list views, `ObjectDataPage` for URL filter
  triples, `NavigationRenderer` for hrefs — and each understood only the filter
  shape its own surface used. `ObjectView`'s opened with
  `if (!Array.isArray(filter)) return filter`, so it could not have been reused
  by dashboard widgets even in principle: widget filters are MongoDB-style
  objects. Widgets therefore got no resolution at all — `DatasetWidget` called
  `resolveDateMacros` and nothing else, which is why `{today}` worked in a widget
  and `{current_user_id}` silently did not.

  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new `utils/filter-tokens.ts` with
    `resolveContextTokens` and `resolveFilterPlaceholders`. The latter expands
    _every_ placeholder vocabulary in one call and is what surfaces should use;
    resolving only some of them is the whole defect. The walk handles arrays and
    plain objects uniformly, so one resolver covers both platform filter shapes.
  - **`@object-ui/react`** — new `FilterScopeProvider` / `useFilterScope`. The
    renderer packages deliberately do not depend on `@object-ui/auth`, so the
    shell supplies the session values. This is a separate context from
    `PredicateScopeContext`, which is the expression evaluation scope and carries
    no organization.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` / `@object-ui/plugin-charts`** — all six
    widgets that previously resolved date macros only now resolve both
    vocabularies: `DatasetWidget`, `ObjectMetricWidget`, `ObjectDataTable`,
    `ObjectPivotTable`, and `ObjectChart` (dataset-bound and inline paths). The
    chart's `compareTo` comparison filter gets the session pass too — otherwise
    the overlay series silently ignored the owner clause the primary series
    honoured.
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `ObjectView`'s local `substituteFilterTokens`
    and `ObjectDataPage`'s inline `=== '{current_user_id}'` ternary now delegate
    to the shared resolver, so both also gain `{current_org_id}` and date macros.
    Two of the three ad-hoc implementations are gone rather than joined by a
    fourth.

  An unresolvable token is left intact rather than dropped: leaving it yields an
  empty result, whereas dropping the clause would _widen_ the result set and show
  a signed-out viewer everyone's data. It is no longer silent — the resolver
  warns, naming the token, and suggests the intended spelling for known
  near-misses (`{current_user}`, `{user_id}`, `{organization_id}`). Authoring-time
  enforcement lands separately as `filter-token-unknown` in `@objectstack/lint`.

- e16ed2d: fix(dashboard,charts): send widget `dateGranularity`/`sortBy`/`limit` to the query, and give funnels a real stage order (framework#3588)

  `DatasetWidget` never read `widget.options`. Four keys an author writes there
  change the query the server compiles, so a widget declaring
  `options: { dateGranularity: 'month' }` grouped by the raw timestamp and drew
  one bar per record, and `sortBy`/`sortOrder` produced no ordering at all.

  - `DatasetWidget` lowers `options.dateGranularity`, `options.sortBy` +
    `options.sortOrder`, and `options.limit` into the `DatasetSelection` it posts.
    A `sortBy` naming something the widget does not project is dropped rather than
    sent, so a stale sort key left by an edit degrades to "unordered" instead of
    failing the widget against the server's stricter validation. These keys also
    join the refetch signature, so editing one in the designer refetches instead
    of re-rendering the previous grid.
  - Funnel stages follow a **declared order**. `AdvancedChartImpl` sorted funnel
    segments by value descending, unconditionally — which overrode any server
    ordering and rendered a sales pipeline as a tidy narrowing shape whatever the
    stages' real sequence, hiding the very anomaly (a bulge at Proposal) the chart
    exists to show. It now honours a `categoryOrder`, which `DatasetWidget`
    derives from the dimension field's picklist option order — the pipeline order
    an author already declared on the object — or from an explicit
    `options.stageOrder`. With no declared order the value-descending default is
    unchanged, and a category missing from the order is kept (after the declared
    ones), never dropped.
  - New `@object-ui/core` helpers `buildCategoryOrder` / `buildCategoryRank`,
    keyed by both the stored value and the display label like the existing
    `buildOptionColorMap`, so ordering works whether or not the server resolved
    the dimension's labels.

  Requires the framework-side fix in objectstack#3588 for the selection keys to
  take effect server-side.

- 6e8fd3c: fix(charts): a fieldless `count` aggregate keyed its value column `undefined`, so the chart plotted nothing (framework#3701)

  framework#3701 pinned down what an OBJECT-bound chart aggregate names its result
  columns — the raw field names it was given (`groupBy` for the category, `field`
  for the value; no `sum_`-style decoration, unlike a dataset measure), plus the
  literal `count` when a `count` omits `field`, which is the alias the engine
  projects `COUNT(*)` under. `os validate` now lints page sources against that
  convention, so the paths that build these rows have to honour it exactly.

  Three of the four did. The odd one out was `count` — the one function that may
  legitimately omit `field` — because every row builder read `params.field`
  directly:

  - `aggregateRecords` / `ObjectDataSource.aggregateClientSide` emitted
    `{ [groupBy]: key, [undefined]: value }`, i.e. a column literally named
    `undefined` that no axis binding could ever name;
  - the legacy analytics path was worse: it remapped the server's `count` measure
    onto `params.field` and **deleted** the original key, so the value the server
    did return was thrown away before the chart saw it.

  All of them now resolve the column through one helper (`aggregateValueKey`) so a
  fieldless count lands under `count`, matching the framework contract. The
  comparison-overlay column is derived from the same key (`count__comparison`
  instead of `undefined__comparison`), and `aggregate.field` is typed optional to
  match the spec's `ChartAggregateSchema`. Charts that name a field are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- ebe6494: chore(lint): clear the baseline lint errors in nine more packages (objectui#2713 Wave 2)

  Second wave of the #2713 lint-gate restoration (after #2730). These nine package
  lints were red at baseline on `main`, so their per-package `lint` gate could not
  catch new violations. Cleared every **error** (no behavior change; warnings out
  of scope):

  - **`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`** (`i18n`, `plugin-grid`, `plugin-view`,
    `plugin-list`) — translation helpers (`useSafeFieldLabel`,
    `useRowActionTranslation`, `useViewLabel`, `useViewTabLabel`, `useMoreLabel`)
    wrapped a provider-safe hook (`useObjectTranslation`/`useObjectLabel`, which
    never throw) in try/catch; removed the wrapper (the same fix #2709 applied in
    fields). `plugin-kanban` `ObjectKanban` moved its `if (error)` early return
    below the `useCallback` so hooks run unconditionally. `collaboration`
    `__unsafe_usePresenceContext` keeps its deliberate danger-prefix name via a
    justified scoped disable.
  - **`react-hooks/static-components`** (`layout`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-report`)
    — dynamic-icon / registry lookups (`resolveIcon`, `useRegistryComponent`) are
    stable component references, not components created during render → scoped
    disable with justification. `plugin-charts` `TreemapCell` was a _genuine_
    inline component and is hoisted to module scope (it is purely props-driven).
  - **`no-irregular-whitespace`** (`plugin-grid` `ImportWizard`) — the literal
    U+FEFF BOM prepended to exported CSV/text blobs (so Excel detects UTF-8) is
    now written as the `﻿` escape: byte-identical at runtime, no literal
    irregular-whitespace character in source.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`plugin-grid` `BulkActionDialog`) — dropped a
    dead `= null` initializer that the exhaustive `switch` (incl. `default`)
    overwrites before it is read.
  - **`no-unsafe-function-type`** (`plugin-view` `ViewTabBar`) — the dnd-kit
    render-prop `listeners` map is typed `Record<string, (...args: any[]) => void>`
    instead of bare `Function`.
  - **`no-require-imports`** (`plugin-kanban`, `plugin-view` tests) — hoisted
    `vi.mock` factories use an `async` factory with `await import('react')`.

### Patch Changes

- fae75e2: Fix two bugs verified still-present after #2254 claimed to resolve them (framework#2620 / framework#2616 Showcase UX pass, tracked in #2268):

  - **Wizard/form `submitBehavior: 'thank-you'` allowed duplicate resubmission.** #2254 fixed the spec-bridge dropping `submitBehavior` before it reached the renderer, so the configured toast message started appearing — but `WizardForm`'s last step and `ObjectForm`'s submit handler only ever called `toast.success(...)` for `thank-you`/`next-record`; the form stayed mounted and fully filled with its submit button re-enabled once the request settled, so a second click created a second record. Both components now track a terminal `submitted` state and, when set, replace the form with a confirmation panel (using the behavior's `title`/`message`, which were also never read before) — mirroring the pattern `apps/console/src/components/FormPage.tsx` already used for its own standalone forms.

  - **Command Center-style 3-up chart bands stayed collapsed to ~100-130px, and a dataset-bound chart's measure leaked its raw field name.**
    - `responsiveStyles` (and `style`) were declared on the page-spec `PageComponent` bridge input type but never copied onto the `SchemaNode` in `spec-bridge/bridges/page.ts::mapComponent()` — so a page author's ADR-0065 layout override (e.g. forcing `display: 'grid'` on a `type: 'flex'` band) never reached `SchemaRenderer`, and the node silently fell back to its default flex layout. Both fields are now mapped through.
    - `ObjectChart`'s dataset-bound fetch path (`schema.dataset` + `ds.queryDataset(...)`) discarded the response's `fields` array (which carries each measure's `label`, e.g. `{ name: 'task_count', label: 'Tasks' }`) before it ever reached `buildChartSeries()` — whose `fields` param already resolves this correctly (see `chart-series.test.ts`) — so the legend/tooltip always fell back to the raw field name. The fetched `fields` are now captured and threaded through.

### Minor Changes

- 677f7ed: feat(charts,dashboard): data-screen customization primitives

  - object-metric `variant:'bare'` — big tinted number + label, no card chrome
    (data-screen KPIs that stay data-bound).
  - object-chart `colors` prop overrides the theme `--chart-1..n` palette so a
    page/dashboard can brand its charts; compact metric formatting (`'0.0a'` →
    "1.1M").
  - ObjectChartSchema.chartType widened to donut/horizontal-bar/column.

### Patch Changes

- 08c47da: feat(dashboard): dataset chart widgets paint select/lookup dimensions in their option colors

  A dashboard `DatasetWidget` chart grouped by a select/lookup dimension (e.g.
  project `health`) painted its categories from the generic `--chart-1..5`
  palette — the same gap the chart view (`object-chart`) had before #1932. It now
  resolves the dimension field's option colors (using the dataset's base `object`

  - dimension→field map the query already returns) and threads them to the
    renderer as a per-category `categoryColors` map, so health green/red/yellow
    paints semantically.

  The value/label→color resolution is extracted into a shared `buildOptionColorMap`
  (`@object-ui/core`) now used by both `DatasetWidget` and `ObjectChart`.

- 93cf2b1: fix(charts): use field option colors for categorical chart dimensions

  An `object-chart` grouped by a select/lookup field (e.g. project `health`)
  painted its categories from the generic `--chart-1..5` palette, so a "Red"
  health slice rendered teal and "Green" rendered blue. The chart now resolves
  the category dimension's option colors — both the `objectName` + `groupBy`
  path and the dataset path (via the dataset's `object` + dimension `field`) —
  and threads them to the renderer as a per-category `categoryColors` map. That
  map wins over the positional palette and falls back to it for categories
  without an option color, so pie/donut slices and bar cells render in their
  semantic colors.

## 7.0.0

### Patch Changes

- c5a7d6f: Bar-chart X-axis labels no longer overlap on narrow widgets. When a chart has
  many categories (>4) or any long label (>8 chars), the tick labels are angled
  (-32°) and truncated with a hover `title`; few short labels stay horizontal.
- cb2fdb1: feat(dashboard): expand drill-in — table/list row→record + scatter/treemap/sankey drill-through

  Drill-in now covers the widgets that were missing it, and formalizes the two
  interaction semantics mainstream BI/low-code platforms separate. `DrillDownConfig`
  gains a `mode` discriminator: `'filter'` (drill-through: aggregate bucket → filtered
  record list) and `'record'` (drill-to-record: a table/list row → that record's detail).

  - Scatter, treemap and sankey charts now wire click → the existing filtered-record
    drill drawer (radar excluded — no single clickable category point). The
    Recharts-payload → drill-event mapping is extracted to pure, tested functions.
  - Object-backed table/list widgets drill to the clicked record in a read-only detail
    drawer (Sheet/Dialog), on by default (`drillDown:{enabled:false}` opts out). Field
    labels and value formatting (incl. tenant-default currency) are shared with the
    table cells so a value reads identically in both. An author-supplied `onRowClick`
    still wins.
  - The chart/KPI drill-through record lists now drill into a record too, completing the
    segment → list → record chain.

- c3749eb: feat(dashboard): dataset chart widgets drill through to records

  Dataset-bound **chart** widgets (bar/line/pie/area/donut/funnel/…) are now
  click-drillable, matching table/pivot. Clicking a segment maps it back to its
  dataset row and opens the same governed drill drawer (raw group keys preserved),
  so a chart-only dashboard is no longer an exploration dead-end. This closes the
  "object-backed chart drills but dataset chart doesn't" inconsistency and aligns
  with mainstream BI (click a chart → see records).

  - `@object-ui/core`: `findChartSeriesRow` — inverse of `buildChartSeries`,
    maps a clicked `{category, series}` back to the source dataset row index
    (matches both dims when a 2nd dimension is pivoted into series).
  - `ObjectChart`: optional `onSegmentClick` lets a host own the chart click
    (and suppress the widget's own object-drill).
  - `DatasetWidget`: lifts the drill machinery to cover both table/pivot and
    chart, and wires the chart's segment click to the precise dataset drill.

- 6cfa330: feat(dashboard): drill "Open in list" escape hatch + unify report drill

  Adopts the mainstream BI peek-then-escalate drill model. Drill-through opens an
  in-place drawer (keep context) and offers an "Open in list →" affordance to
  escalate to the object's full list page (sort / bulk-select / export / shareable
  URL) — the Looker / Power BI "see records → open in page" pattern.

  - New `DrillNavigationContext` (`@object-ui/react`): the app shell provides
    `openRecordList`; the renderer stays decoupled from console routing.
  - The drill drawers (pivot / dataset / chart / KPI) render the escape hatch when
    a host navigation handler is present, and hide it otherwise (self-contained
    peek). `DashboardView` provides the handler via `useOpenRecordList`.
  - `DrillDownConfig.target` gains `'navigate'` — skip the drawer and open the
    list directly; degrades to `'drawer'` when no host handler is available.
  - `ReportView` drill-through now opens the same in-place drawer (peek records →
    click a row to open a record) instead of navigating away; the escape hatch
    preserves the previous navigate-to-list behavior. Dashboard and report drill
    are now unified.
  - i18n: `dashboard.openInList` (en / zh).

- e270c7d: fix(chart): consume ADR-0021 `dataset` binding in list/object chart views

  Chart views authored to the current spec (ADR-0021: `dataset` + `dimensions` +
  `values`) previously rendered nothing — the renderers only read the **removed**
  legacy inline `xAxisField` / `yAxisFields` / `aggregation` shape, so a
  spec-compliant chart view showed an empty canvas. `ObjectChart` now runs the
  governed `queryDataset` path when a chart binds to a dataset (the same path the
  dashboard `DatasetWidget` uses, so numbers stay consistent), and `ListView` /
  `ObjectView` emit the dataset shape. The legacy inline aggregate is kept as a
  deprecated fallback so pre-ADR-0021 metadata keeps rendering.

  Refs objectstack-ai/objectstack#1890

- ab168e4: Dashboard charts no longer render blank on first paint. Recharts'
  `ResponsiveContainer` was a child of a `flex … justify-center` box, so it
  collapsed to content width (0) on first paint inside react-grid-layout,
  measured `width(-1)` and skipped drawing until a later resize fired its
  ResizeObserver. The chart wrapper is now a definite-width block in both the
  dashboard chart container (`plugin-charts/ChartContainerImpl`) and the shadcn
  base (`components/ui/chart`). Follow-up changeset for #1634.

### Minor Changes

- 991b62d: Add `compareTo` field to dashboard widgets for period-over-period
  comparison. Supports `'previousPeriod'`, `'previousYear'`, and
  `{ offset: '7d' | '4w' | '1M' | '1y' }`.

  - **Metric / gauge widgets** now compute a delta percentage when `compareTo`
    is set and surface it as a derived `trend` (auto-labelled via
    `dashboard.trend.vsLast*` i18n keys sniffed from the filter macros).
  - **Chart widgets** (line / area / bar / horizontal-bar / scatter / combo)
    overlay a muted comparison-period series (dashed line, lower fill opacity).
    Pie / donut / funnel ignore `compareTo`.
  - New core utilities: `shiftFilterByCompareTo`, `compareToTrendLabelKey`,
    `computeMetricDelta`, and `CompareToConfig` type.
  - `ChartSeries` now accepts `variant: 'comparison'`, `dashArray`, and
    `opacity` overrides for visual treatment.

  See `packages/plugin-dashboard/SKILL.md` for usage examples.

## 4.1.0

### Patch Changes

- b4ce9e2: Fix summary reports: render chart + KPIs, correct empty-table on server-aggregated data.
  - `plugin-report`: `SpecReportGrid` now renders a KPI strip (per aggregating column) and a chart section above the grid for `summary` reports. KPI section auto-hides when no aggregating columns. New `buildChartData()` adapter buckets aggregated `ReportRow[]` to chart-ready data, auto-sorts pie/funnel descending, and falls back to row count when the chart `yAxis` points at a non-numeric column. When the data is server-aggregated, the grid switches columns to `[groupings, ${field}__${agg}]` so cells aren't empty against a raw-row column schema.
  - `plugin-charts`: register `'column'` as an alias of `'bar'` in `ChartRenderer` / `AdvancedChartImpl` (Recharts only has `BarChart`).
  - `app-shell`: `ReportView` now routes any object-backed report (matrix/joined/summary/tabular/columns/groupingsAcross) through the spec `ReportRenderer`; fully-legacy `fields`+`data` schemas still use `ReportViewer`.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
