/**
 * #4123 — what ARMS the `?runAction=create_environment` deep link, and what
 * happens when the thing it names is not on the bar.
 *
 * Consumption of this deep link is modelled as "strip the param from the URL",
 * so arming is destructive: whatever arms it spends a one-shot user intent that
 * a reload cannot recreate. The arming predicate must therefore agree with what
 * actually renders — if it can arm while the create action is absent, the
 * intent is spent on nothing and is gone for good (`urlParam=null execute=0`,
 * the measurement on the card).
 *
 * ## Why this file drives the REAL bar
 *
 * The sibling `EnvironmentListToolbar.test.tsx` stubs `SchemaRenderer` to
 * inspect the schema the toolbar hands down. That stub cannot see this defect
 * class at all, because the divergence lives INSIDE `action:bar`: the ADR-0066
 * D4 capability gate (`useCapabilityGate` over `requiredPermissions`) filters
 * the actions the bar RENDERS, and the toolbar used to arm off a list computed
 * before that gate ran. Two filters over one list is the bug; only the real bar
 * can demonstrate it. Same reason #3803's investigation had to swap the stub
 * out before it could measure the runner's consumption order.
 *
 * The registry import is at module scope (not in a `beforeAll`) per AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律 — `action:bar` resolves its members through the ComponentRegistry at
 * render time, and the cost belongs in the import phase where no hook timeout
 * applies.
