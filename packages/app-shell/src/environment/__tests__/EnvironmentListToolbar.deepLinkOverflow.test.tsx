/**
 * #4162 — the `?runAction=create_environment` deep link when the create action
 * OVERFLOWS, measured end-to-end on the real toolbar.
 *
 * This is #4123's signature one layer deeper. #4166 fixed what ARMS the deep
 * link (the create action's presence, not "any toolbar action"); arming keys on
 * the post-gate list, which INCLUDES the actions `action:bar` is about to move
 * into the overflow menu. So arming is correct here — it fires, the param is
 * stripped, `autoTrigger` is attached — and the action is then handed to
 * `action:menu`, which used to have no `autoTrigger` handling at all. Measured
 * on the filing's setup before the fix:
 *
 *     PROBE-OVERFLOW: urlParam=null execute=0 buttons=["a1","a2","a3",""]
 *
 * The same end state as #4123 (`urlParam=null execute=0`, the intent spent on
 * nothing and unrecoverable because the strip IS the consumption), reached
 * through a different mechanism and NOT closed by #4166.
 *
 * The fix is in `@object-ui/components` (`action:menu` consumes `autoTrigger`
 * by executing); this file is the consumer-side proof that the #844 welcome-page
 * flow now survives a toolbar shape where the create action is fourth. The
 * sibling `EnvironmentListToolbar.deepLinkArming.test.tsx` (#4123/#4166) pins
 * the arming half and is deliberately untouched.
 *
 * The registry import is at module scope (not in a `beforeAll`) per AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律 — `action:bar` resolves its members through the ComponentRegistry at
 * render time, and the cost belongs in the import phase where no hook timeout
 * applies.

/**
 * The card's shape: a create action that declares neither `order` nor
 * `variant: 'primary'`, registered LAST. `action:bar`'s `needsOrdering` is then
 * false, so registration order stands and the 4th action lands past the desktop
 * `maxVisible: 3` — in the overflow menu.
 *
 * The `setup_production` state is safe today only by accident: the toolbar's own
 * label override gives the create action `variant: 'primary'`, which flips
 * `needsOrdering` and floats it into the primary slot. `add_development` applies
 * no variant, which is why this file uses it.
