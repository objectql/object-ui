/**
 * objectui#6043 — `MetadataService` never writes `formula`, and does not rename
 * it to `expression` either.
 *
 * Surfaced by the key-level parity gate built for objectui#5761
 * (`scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`). `FieldMetadataPayload` is one
 * of that gate's two `wire` shapes: `toFieldPayload` builds it and `saveFields`
 * PUTs `fields.map(toFieldPayload)` to `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name`.
 *
 * `formula` is not in `FieldSchema`'s accept set. Measured against the installed
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0:
 *
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type:'formula', label:'Total', formula:'price * quantity' })
 *     => success = false
 *     => unrecognized_keys ['formula']
 *        "Did you mean `formula` -> `expression`?"
 *
 * which the route returns as a hard 422 `INVALID_METADATA`. Because the key is
 * then STORED, every later save of that object fails the same way.
 *
 * ## The rename this file proves was NOT taken
 *
 * The obvious repair — emit `expression` instead — was refused, and the control
 * below is what keeps that decision legible. `FieldSchema` judges the KEY, never
 * the expression LANGUAGE: it accepts `expression: '!!!not cel at all!!!'`.
 * Spec `expression` is CEL rooted at `record`, whereas the designer control this
 * card retired taught `price * quantity` — bare field refs that evaluate to null
 * silently under the scope formulas bind. Renaming would therefore have replaced
 * a loud 422 with a formula that saves clean and computes nothing.
 *
 * Assertions are on the bytes actually PUT — `JSON.parse` of the captured
 * request body — not on the object handed to the client. A property whose value
 * is `undefined` is a key zod's strict object COUNTS but `JSON.stringify` DROPS,
 * so an in-memory assertion and a wire assertion disagree exactly here.
 *
 * This file names no `reference`/`referenceTo` key, so reverting objectui#6041
 * cannot red it, and vice versa.
