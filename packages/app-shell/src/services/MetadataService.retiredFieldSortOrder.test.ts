/**
 * objectui#6045 — `MetadataService` never writes a field-level `sortOrder`.
 *
 * Surfaced by the key-level parity gate built for objectui#5761
 * (`scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`). `FieldMetadataPayload` is one
 * of that gate's field-level `wire` shapes: `toFieldPayload` builds it and
 * `saveFields` PUTs `fields.map(toFieldPayload)` to
 * `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name`.
 *
 * `sortOrder` is not in `FieldSchema`'s accept set. Measured against the
 * installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0:
 *
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type:'text', label:'L', sortOrder: 3 })
 *     => success = false
 *     => unrecognized_keys ['sortOrder']
 *
 * which the route returns as a hard 422 `INVALID_METADATA`. Because the key is
 * then STORED, every later save of that object fails the same way.
 *
 * ## Why the resolution was deletion, not a rename
 *
 * This is objectui#4687's shape, not objectui#6041's. The spec has no
 * field-level ordering key AT ALL — it models field order by DECLARATION ORDER
 * in the object's `fields` record — so there was no spelling to move to. The
 * near-spelling `sortable` is NOT a rename target and the control below proves
 * it is a different concept: it is a BOOLEAN ("whether field is sortable in
 * list views"), so `sortable: 3` does not even parse.
 *
 * ## What "latent" meant, and which assertion is the load-bearing one
 *
 * Nothing on the tree ever populated a field's `sortOrder`: neither of the two
 * sites that construct a `DesignerFieldDefinition` (`FieldDesigner`'s
 * create/update handlers and `MetadataFieldsPage.toDesignerField`) names the
 * key, so `toFieldPayload` emitted `sortOrder: undefined` and
 * `JSON.stringify` dropped it. That has two consequences for this file:
 *
 *   - The plain "a normal field PUTs no `sortOrder`" case below WOULD STILL
 *     PASS if the copy were restored, exactly as objectui#6223's half-filled
 *     case would. It is here to show the removal did not break the untouched
 *     path — a claim about what did NOT change.
 *   - The SMUGGLED case is the one that reds on a revert, and it is the reason
 *     this file is not a pin on an assertion that cannot fail. Restoring
 *     `sortOrder: field.sortOrder` in `toFieldPayload` puts the key back on the
 *     wire and fails it.
 *
 * Assertions are on the bytes actually PUT — `JSON.parse` of the captured
 * request body — not on the object handed to the client. A property whose value
 * is `undefined` is a key zod's strict object COUNTS but `JSON.stringify`
 * DROPS, so an in-memory assertion and a wire assertion disagree exactly here.
 *
 * ## The two keys that share this spelling and are NOT this card
 *
 * `sortOrder` names three unrelated concepts in this repo, which is why the
 * census for this card was on the SHAPE (a field-metadata payload key
 * `FieldSchema` refuses) rather than on the identifier:
 *
 *   - OBJECT-level `sortOrder` — the Object Manager's display order, refused by
 *     `ObjectSchema`, removed from the object wire shape by objectui#6223 and
 *     deliberately KEPT on the `ObjectDefinition` UI model. Pinned by
 *     `MetadataService.specKeyObjectPayload.test.ts`.
 *   - SAVED-VIEW `sortOrder` — `ObjectView.tsx`'s per-view display order, a
 *     real persisted key on a different document entirely.
 *
 * This file names neither, so reverting either of those cannot red it.
