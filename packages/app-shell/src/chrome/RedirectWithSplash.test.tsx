/**
 * objectui#6378 — the console boot must never hand the viewport to an empty
 * document.
 *
 * ## What this file can and cannot see
 *
 * The defect is a TIMING one: a bare `<Navigate>` renders null, and the
 * destination tree then renders at transition priority, so for 41–147 ms
 * (measured on the production bundle — a CDP screencast frame ledger correlated
 * against a DOM-state ledger on the same clock) `#root` holds no view and the
 * compositor may swap a fully white frame.
 *
 * jsdom has no compositor and no CSS engine, so **nothing here measures that
 * window**. Asserting "no flash" in jsdom would be a test that passes because
 * the phenomenon cannot exist there, which is precisely the shape this card
 * exists to avoid. What this file pins is the STRUCTURAL half, which is where
 * the fix lives: the element the gate hands off to renders the splash, and it
 * still performs the same navigation with the same history semantics. The
 * timing claim is measured only in a real browser —
 * `e2e/console-boot-indicator.spec.ts` carries the end-to-end invariant and the
 * pixel ledger is recorded in the pull request.
 *
 * The two halves are pinned SEPARATELY on purpose. A single "it redirects"
 * assertion stays green when the splash is dropped (the navigation is
 * unaffected), and losing the splash is the only regression this component
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing in react-router is stubbed: the real `<Navigate>` renders null, and
 * that nullness IS the thing being worked around, so replacing it with a marker
 * would hide the subject.
