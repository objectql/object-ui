/**
 * objectui#7482 — 「客户更新成功」 was still on screen 90 seconds after a record
 * save, sitting exactly on the assistant rail's send button; only the × closed
 * it.
 *
 * Two facts, and the second explains the first. The toaster has always carried
 * a 4s default and `crud_success` passes no duration of its own, so nothing
 * about the DURATION was wrong. What was wrong is where the toaster was
 * anchored: `apps/console` overrode it to `bottom-right`, the corner ADR-0057
 * later gave to the ChatDock composer and its FAB. Sonner pauses a toast's
 * dismiss timer whenever the pointer is inside the toaster region —
 *
 *     if (expanded || interacting || isDocumentHidden) pauseTimer();
 *     else startTimer();                        (sonner 2.0.8, Toast effect)
 *
 * — and `expanded` is set by the region's own `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseMove`. A
 * pointer resting on the composer underneath therefore held the timer at zero
 * for as long as it stayed there. Covering the button and never dismissing were
 * one defect, not two.
 *
 * So this file pins the two properties the fix rests on: the default anchor is
 * the top-right corner (nothing interactive lives there), and a success toast
 * really does dismiss itself inside the 3–5s band the card asked for.
