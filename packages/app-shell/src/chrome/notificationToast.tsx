/**
 * The console's `toast` surface.
 *
 * `NotificationProvider` presents four of the five spec display types through
 * surface components (#3014); `toast` is the one it delegates, and in the
 * console that delegate is sonner. This module is that bridge — it is the
 * ONLY place a notification becomes a sonner call, so the mapping (severity →
 * variant, `duration: 0` → persistent, first action → the toast's action
 * button) lives in one testable function rather than inline in the shell.
 *
 * Non-toast display types never reach here: the provider routes them to
 * `NotificationBanners` / `NotificationSnackbar` / `NotificationAlerts` /
 * `NotificationInline` instead.
