/**
 * objectui#6654 — the discovery wire may no longer turn authentication off.
 *
 * ## What was removed
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` retired the `RuntimeMode` value `'preview'` and the whole
 * `PreviewModeConfig` block (objectstack#11846). This console read that wire
 * surface back: a discovery response whose `mode` was `'preview'` took a branch
 * that called `setAuthEnabled(false)` and simulated an identity out of
 * `discovery.previewMode`. The producer is retired; the consumer is now gone.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Which assertions here are evidence, and which are only cheap insurance
 *
 * The removed gate was `discovery?.mode === 'preview'` — NOT the presence of a
 * `previewMode` block. `previewMode` only supplied the details, every one of
 * them behind a default. That distinction decides what can be proved:
 *
 * - The `mode: 'preview'` cases are the LOAD-BEARING ones. Each was measured
 *   red against the pre-change component (it handed `AuthProvider` a
 *   `previewMode` prop and turned auth off).
 * - The `previewMode`-without-`mode: 'preview'` case is ALREADY GREEN against
 *   the pre-change component — that payload took the ordinary path before this
 *   change too. It is kept as a regression net, and labelled so that no future
 *   reader mistakes a never-red assertion for the one that bites.
 *
 * ## The failure direction this change accepts
 *
 * A deployment still emitting `mode: 'preview'` now falls back to the ordinary
 * auth reading — it requires login. Loud, diagnosable and more secure than a
 * dormant auth-off path keyed on a spelling the platform no longer produces.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT touched
 *
 * `AuthProvider`'s `previewMode` PROP, `useAuth().previewMode` and
 * `PreviewBanner` are a separate published capability with a different producer
 * (a host passing the prop). This file retires the discovery-wire producer of
 * that prop, never the prop itself.
