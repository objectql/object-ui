/**
 * Sentry integration — configured by the RUNTIME, on `/api/v1/runtime/config`.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  - **Zero cost when disabled.** `@sentry/react` is dynamically imported only
 *    when the runtime served a DSN, so deployments without Sentry pay zero
 *    bundle bytes and issue no third-party request at all.
 *  - **Graceful degradation.** If init fails (network, a hosting-layer CSP,
 *    etc.) we log a warning and continue — the host app must still render.
 *  - **One source of truth.** Every knob that decides WHAT is sent arrives in
 *    one object from one place.
 *
 * ## Fail direction: when in doubt, DO NOT SEND (objectui#5522)
 *
 * An air-gapped EE deployment was measured sending 14 Sentry envelopes per
 * session to sentry.io with IP + User-Agent PII, unstoppable by the customer
 * (objectstack-ai/cloud#1508). `@object-ui/console` publishes ONE pre-built SPA
 * that both the hosted SaaS console and the on-premises / air-gapped EE images
 * embed, so anything baked into the bundle lands inside customer networks and
 * cannot be reconfigured afterwards.
 *
 * Hence this module fails CLOSED, the opposite of the usual gate: an unreported
 * error is recoverable, PII leaving an air-gapped deployment is not.
 *
 * ## Why the DSN moved to the server (objectstack#12681)
 *
 * The first fix made the DSN a build-time `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and added a runtime
 * PERMISSION beside it, so reporting needed both. That closed the leak and
 * opened a different hole, which the maintainer named on 2026-08-27, verbatim
 * and untranslated:
 *
 * > 「我是一个开发平台呀，我的用户并不会去构建我的前端，我理解这种应该在服务端传进去。」
 *
 * ObjectStack's users consume a PREBUILT console. They cannot set a build-time
 * key, so under the two-key gate a self-hosting operator could not enable error
 * reporting at all: the permission was reachable and the source was not. The
 * DSN — and every knob that must travel with it — now arrives from the runtime,
 * and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is retired rather than kept as a second path.
 *
 * ```
 * send  ⇔  the RUNTIME served a DSN
 * ```
 *
 * **The DSN's presence IS the grant**, and there is no companion boolean. That
 * is not shorthand: two knobs in two places produced two silent dead states
 * ("permission on, no DSN" / "DSN in, permission off") that look identical from
 * the browser. One knob cannot disagree with itself. Turning reporting off is
 * unsetting the server DSN — there is deliberately no build-time force-off left
 * to forget, because on a prebuilt console nobody can reach one anyway.
 *
 * Runtime config consumed — the whole telemetry decision, from
 * `telemetry.errorReporting` on `/api/v1/runtime/config`:
 *
 *  - `dsn`                       — the sink. Absent/unreachable ⇒ do not send.
 *  - `sendDefaultPii`            — IP + User-Agent. Opt-in.
 *  - `environment`               — event tag; falls back to Vite's `MODE`.
 *  - `tracesSampleRate`          — transaction sampling.
 *  - `replaysOnErrorSampleRate`  — error-session replay sampling.
 *
 * Env vars consumed — exactly one, and it is a property of the BUILD:
 *
 *  - `VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE` — which bundle produced a stack trace. It must match
 *    the source maps that bundle's pipeline uploaded, and a server cannot know
 *    which Console build it is serving, so this one stays build-time. Falls
 *    back to `VITE_APP_VERSION`, then `'unknown'`.

 *
 * The parameter is REQUIRED and nullable rather than optional. Both spellings
 * fail closed, but only a required parameter makes the compiler refuse a caller
 * that never considered the question — and "a caller that never considered the
 * question" is this defect class entirely. Callers read it from
 * {@link getClientErrorReporting}, which owns the fail-closed reading of the
 * payload.
 *
 * It takes no `env` argument any more, and that absence is the point: nothing
 * a build was compiled with can influence whether reporting happens. The one
