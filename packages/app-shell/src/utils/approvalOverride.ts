 * approvalOverride — the ONE place the console answers "is this decision an
 * ADMIN OVERRIDE?" (objectui#5178).
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * framework#3424 gives a platform/tenant admin a privileged decision path: they
 * may approve / reject / reassign a request they hold no slot in, so a request
 * routed to an unstaffed position is rescuable instead of locking its record
 * forever. That branch is *authoritative* — it finalises the node even under
 * `per_group` / `unanimous` / `quorum`, bypassing every co-sign group that has
 * not voted.
 *
 * The console rendered it as an ordinary decision: the same filled **Approve**
 * a designated approver sees, one click, no warning. The measured consequence
 * (the report behind objectui#5178) was a PM who clicked Approve *"to see if it
 * was real"* and finalised a stage for an approver who never acted.
 *
 * ## Why the predicate is read, not a name list
 *
 * `sys_approval_request` declares its decision actions as METADATA, and the
 * record page's whole design is that "a ninth decision action ships as metadata
 * alone" (see `DeclaredActionsBar`). A hard-coded `['approval_approve', …]`
 * list would silently miss that ninth action — it would render as an ordinary
 * decision again, which is the exact defect being fixed.
 *
 * So {@link actionAdmittedByOverride} reads the action's OWN declared `visible`
 * gate — the very predicate that admitted the button — and asks whether it ORs
 * in `can_override`. The three core levers do
 * (`… record.viewer.can_act == true || … record.viewer.can_override == true`);
 * `approval_recall` / `approval_resubmit` gate on `is_submitter` and never
 * match, so a submitter who happens to also hold override rights does not get
 * their recall button relabelled as an override.
 *
 * ## Fail-safe direction
 *
 * Both predicates are deliberately asymmetric: an UNKNOWN reads as "not an
 * override". Labelling an ordinary approval as an override would be a false
 * accusation written into a surface people audit; failing to label one leaves
 * today's behaviour. `viewer` absent (a backend predating framework#3310) and
 * `can_act` absent both therefore yield `false` — which is why the checks are
 * `=== false` / `=== true` rather than truthiness.
