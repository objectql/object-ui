/**
 * Where "home" is — the ONE reader of the product's declared landing.
 *
 * Two different screens have both called themselves the console's home:
 *
 *   - `/home`, the multi-app workspace launcher ("Build an app", "Start from a
 *     template", "Your apps"). Under ADR-0075 that is the ENVIRONMENT layer's
 *     home: its cards act on the environment the SPA is attached to.
 *   - `/apps/<app>`, the landing an App DECLARES with `isDefault: true`. The
 *     landing page WITHIN that app is its first navigation item (spec 17.0.0
 *     retired `app.homePageId`; position in `navigation` is the declaration).
 *
 * `RootLandingRedirect` (apps/console) has honored the declaration on `/` since
 * the hardcoded `PREFERRED_APPS = ['cloud_control']` redirect was retired. The
 * chrome did not: the top-bar logo and every "Home" affordance named `/home`
 * literally, so a deployment that declares a landing showed the customer TWO
 * homes with two different voices — and on cloud's control plane the launcher
 * one is actively wrong (objectui#7256): its "Build an app" / "Start from a
 * template" cards are environment-side actions that cannot work from the
 * control plane, and its "Your apps" tiles are the control plane's own internal
 * management apps.
 *
 * The posture signal is the App metadata the server already sends — NOT a
 * hostname sniff, and NOT a hardcoded product name. `cloud_control` is nowhere
 * in this file on purpose: baking one product's identity into the shared bundle
 * is exactly what the declaration replaced.
 *
 * Layering, so the declaration is read in one place and one place only:
 *   - this module answers "did the product declare a landing?";
 *   - `resolveLandingPath` (apps/console, the `/` entry) layers its
 *     single-visible-app EMPTINESS heuristic on top of that answer;
 *   - `useHomePath()` (the chrome) layers nothing — a persistent "go home"
 *     affordance follows the declaration or the launcher, never a heuristic
 *     about how many apps happen to be visible.
 *

 * re-ordered.
 *
 * The segment is the app's `name` — byte-identical to what `/` has been
 * redirecting to, so the logo and the post-login landing cannot disagree.
 * (`matchAppBySegment()` accepts the name as a per-tenant alias.)
