/**
 * ⭐ THE DISCRIMINATING PIN for objectui#6837 half 2's arm deletion, on
 * `app-shell`'s two exported protocol readers.
 *
 * ## Why a DIVERGENT def BESIDE a legacy-only one — the two answer
 * ## different questions, and an earlier revision of this comment had the
 * ## relationship backwards
 *
 * The refusal pins elsewhere feed a `reference_to`-ONLY def and assert nothing
 * resolves. Work out what each shape does under each way of re-widening the
 * chain — the table is the whole argument:
 *
 *                              legacy-only def        divergent def
 *                              (reference_to only)    (reference:'canonical_target',
 *                                                      reference_to:'legacy_target')
 *   reference only (shipped)   does not resolve  ✅   -> 'canonical_target'  ✅
 *   reference_to || reference  RESOLVES          ❌   -> 'legacy_target'     ❌
 *   reference ?? reference_to  RESOLVES          ❌   -> 'canonical_target'  ✅
 *
 * ⇒ the legacy-only refusal is ORDER-BLIND: it goes red under BOTH re-widening
 * orders, because either one gives a legacy-only def somewhere to resolve from.
 * ⇒ the divergent def is order-SPECIFIC: it goes red only under legacy-first,
 * and stays GREEN under a canonical-first re-widening, which still consults
 * `reference` first and so still answers 'canonical_target'.
 *
 * ⛔ An earlier revision of this docblock claimed the opposite — that a
 * canonical-first re-widening would keep the legacy-only pins green and that
 * the divergent def was needed to catch it. That is measurably backwards, and
 * it is the dangerous direction to be wrong in: read that way, a future
 * maintainer would delete the legacy-only refusals as the redundant half, and
 * lose the only cases that fire under BOTH orders.
 *
 * ⇒ Neither file is redundant. The legacy-only refusals answer "did an arm come
 * back at all"; this file answers "which ORDER came back". Only together do
 * they name the mutation.
 *
 * ⚠️ A divergent def is broken metadata and is not a shape any producer should
 * emit — that is the point. It is a PROBE for which key the reader consults,
 * chosen because it is the only shape whose answer differs per chain. The
 * accompanying single-key cases below are the non-vacuous controls: without
 * them a reader that had stopped resolving anything would satisfy every
 * divergent assertion by returning the canonical value never.
