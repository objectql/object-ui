/**
 * surfaceAgent — the one declarative surface→agent resolver (ADR-0057 P2).
 *
 * ADR-0063 fixes the agent model: **exactly two products (`ask` / `build`),
 * bound by SURFACE — no roster, no per-turn classifier.** Before this module the
 * console re-implemented that resolution chain in ~5 places, each spelled
 * slightly differently (and `ConsoleLayout` carried a downgrade special case
 * that existed nowhere else). This is the single place the rule lives, so
 * ADR-0063 is a **structural** guarantee: there is no seam to add a roster or a
 * classifier into.
 *
 * The rule, in one function:
 *
 *   1. `app.defaultAgent` may override the surface default, but it is **bounded**
 *      to the two products (ask/build, alias-aware). Anything else — a withdrawn
 *      tenant custom agent — is **rejected** (not silently passed through), so a
 *      roster cannot be smuggled in via app metadata (ADR-0057 open question #4).
 *   2. Otherwise the surface decides: the Studio authoring surface wants `build`;
 *      every other surface wants `ask`.
 *   3. With AI Studio disabled the build agent is unreachable, so a `build` want
 *      degrades to `ask` (the former `ConsoleLayout` special case, folded in ONCE).
 *   4. The chosen product is resolved against the LIVE catalog (alias-aware); if
 *      it isn't served, fall back to the catalog's platform default.
 *
 * Kept pure (no React) so every call site resolves identically and the ADR-0063
 * table is unit-tested without the chat component graph.
 *
