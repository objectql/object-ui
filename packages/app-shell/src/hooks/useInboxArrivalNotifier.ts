/**
 * useInboxArrivalNotifier — turn a new inbox row into something the user
 * actually perceives (objectui#7011).
 *
 * The inbox has been silent since it was built: `sharedUserFeeds` polls
 * `sys_inbox_message`, the rows land in the store, the bell badge counts them,
 * and a user not staring at the bell learns nothing. This hook is the whole of
 * the announcement, and it is mounted from `useInboxBell` — the one wiring of
 * the shared feed onto a bell — so every surface that shows the inbox
 * announces it, and none of them announces it twice (the seen set that decides
 * is module-scoped; see `inboxArrivals.ts`).
 *
 * ## What it deliberately is NOT
 *
 * Presentation only. Nothing here touches the transport: no cadence is changed,
 * no request is added, and no push channel (WebSocket / SSE) is opened — those
 * are framework-side platform work with their own project. The consequence is
 * accepted rather than worked around: a backgrounded tab polls at 60 s, so a
 * desktop notification can be up to about a minute late. Shaving that by
 * speeding the poll up would trade a server-wide cost for one surface's
 * latency, which is the trade the card refused.
 *
 * ## The two surfaces are mutually exclusive, by the tab's visibility
 *
 * A visible tab gets the in-page toast; a hidden one gets the system
 * notification and no toast. They are not two channels a user might get both
 * of: a toast fired into a hidden tab is a toast that expires unseen, and a
 * system notification raised over a tab the user is looking at is an OS-level
 * interruption for something already on their screen.
