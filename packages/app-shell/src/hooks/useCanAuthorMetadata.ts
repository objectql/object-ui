 * May this session author metadata?
 *
 * Extracted from the console HomePage (where it gated the builder CTAs) when
 * the maker convergence (cloud#1674) made the SAME question decide which chat
 * composer a console session gets — one shared answer, not two drifting copies.
 *
 * objectstack#8270 — on the EE single-database multi-tenant deployment a
 * workspace owner holds `org_owner` + `organization_admin` but NOT
 * `manage_metadata`; that absence is the intended hosted posture (maintainer
 * ruling 2026-08-13), not a missing grant. `useWorkspaceAdminStatus` reads the
 * session's POSITIONS (spelled `roles` until framework ADR-0090 D3 renamed it;
 * objectui#5389 moved this hook onto the live spelling, and `org_owner` is in
 * that array either way), so it says `true` for that owner and the builder CTAs
 * rendered — the owner followed "Build an app", filled in the new-package
 * dialog, and hit a raw capability refusal at submit. This consumes the answer
 * the server already gives (`GET /api/v1/auth/me/permissions` →
 * `systemPermissions`, surfaced by `MePermissionsProvider`); it does NOT
 * re-derive permission logic client-side.
 *
 * **Unknown → fail OPEN**, the same doctrine `useCapabilityGate` states for
 * ADR-0066 gates (framework#3923): the server enforces regardless, and hiding a
 * permitted user's primary CTA on missing client data is the worse failure.
 * `MePermissionsProvider` now preserves the absent-vs-empty distinction
 * natively (objectui#4656) — `hasCapabilities` itself returns `true` when the
 * backend never reported `systemPermissions` at all (a deployment predating
 * ADR-0066), and gates normally on a real answer, including a genuinely
 * EMPTY one. This hook no longer re-derives that heuristic locally; it just
 * asks the centralized signal. The ruled case is unaffected: the EE owner's
 * set is non-empty (`manage_org_users`, `setup.access`, `setup.write`), so it
 * gates closed. Hosts with no permission provider at all already fail open
 * inside `usePermissions`.
