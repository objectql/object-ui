/**
 * useAiSurfaceEnabled
 *
 * Single source of truth for "should the in-UI AI surface be shown — for THIS
 * user, on this deployment?". The console ships under MIT and is edition- and
 * seat-agnostic at build time; it decides purely at runtime from what the
 * server reports — no `VITE_EDITION` flag, no tree-shake.
 *
 * The signal is **the agent catalog** (`GET /api/v1/ai/agents`): the surface
 * shows iff that returns >= 1 agent. The catalog is the right signal because it
 * is the ONLY one that is BOTH edition- AND user-aware:
 *
 *   • The route is access-filtered server-side (ADR-0049 / ADR-0068): it returns
 *     only the agents the CALLER may chat. A user WITHOUT the per-user AI seat
 *     (the `ai_seat` permission) gets an EMPTY catalog -> the whole AI surface
 *     hides for them, instead of showing a button that 403s on click. The
 *     deployment-wide discovery `services.ai` flag CANNOT express this — it is
 *     identical for every user — which is exactly why we do NOT gate on it.
 *   • It is ALSO the honest edition signal: a Community-Edition runtime that
 *     ships no `@objectstack/service-ai` registers no AI service and persists no
 *     agents -> empty catalog -> hidden. (The old "headless service reports
 *     available in CE" worry is moot: empty catalog hides the surface either way.)
 *
 * ⚠️  Do NOT "simplify" this back to `discovery.services.ai` (isAiEnabled): that
 * reintroduces the per-user gap — seat-less users would see the FAB / links and
 * hit 403 on click. The per-user AI-seat gate (ADR-0068) DEPENDS on this catalog
 * signal. (This reverts objectui#1992, which dropped the per-user dimension.)
 *
 * The `VITE_AI_BASE_URL` opt-in flows through naturally: {@link resolveAiApiBase}
 * points the catalog fetch at the configured server, so an external AI server
 * with reachable agents lights the surface up and an agent-less one keeps it hidden.
 *
 * `isLoading` is surfaced so the `/ai` route guard can wait for the catalog to
 * resolve before redirecting — otherwise a stale bookmark would flash a redirect
 * to home before the fetch even starts. Entry-point buttons (FAB, top-bar link,
 * designer "Ask AI") ignore it: staying hidden during the brief load is the
 * correct, flash-free behaviour for a control that must not appear unless AI can
 * actually answer.
