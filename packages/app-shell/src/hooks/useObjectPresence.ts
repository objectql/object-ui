/**
 * "Does this deployment HAVE that object?", answered from the metadata registry
 * the shell already loads — so a surface that reads an OPTIONAL system object
 * can decline to ask rather than asking and being told no.
 *
 * ## Why (objectui#7476)
 *
 * A tenant environment has no `sys_activity` (no plugin-audit), so the home
 * page's activity card and the bell's Activity tab issued
 * `GET /api/v1/data/sys_activity` on every page load and got a 404. Everything
 * DOWNSTREAM of that 404 is already correct and stays correct: the adapter
 * memoizes the missing collection so no second request goes out, its quiet
 * logger demotes the failure to `debug`, `sharedUserFeeds` retires the feed as
 * an ANSWER (`ready`, not `error`), and the panel renders its earned
 * 「暂无最近动态」 empty state. What was left is one doomed request per load —
 * and `data-objectstack`'s own rule for exactly this case says how to read
 * that: *"The cure for doomed requests is not issuing them, never hiding them
 * once issued."*
 *
 * ## The predicate, and why every uncertainty reads as `unknown`
 *
 * The cost of a wrong `absent` is not one extra request, it is a feed that
 * never loads on a deployment that DOES have the object — so absence has to be
 * evidence, never the default:
 *
 *  - the registry has not answered (`idle` / `loading` / `error`) → `unknown`;
 *  - the registry is `ready` but lists ZERO objects → `unknown`. This is the
 *    load-bearing clause. `useMetadata()` outside a `<MetadataProvider>`
 *    returns a frozen no-op whose `getTypeStatus` answers `'ready'` and whose
 *    `getItemsByType` answers `[]` — a shape that reads as "ready, and the
 *    object is not there" while meaning "nobody is answering". An empty
 *    registry is not evidence of anything;
 *  - `ready`, non-empty, and the name is in it → `present`;
 *  - `ready`, non-empty, and the name is not → `absent`. Only here.
 *
 * `sys_*` objects ARE in this list where they exist — `AppHeader` filters them
 * out of the app-object picker by name (`!o.name.startsWith('sys_')`), which
 * it would not need to do if they were absent, and the console resolves
 * `/apps/{any app}/sys_activity` as an ordinary object route (objectui#4074).
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * None: `getItemsByType('object')` reads the same cache the nav, the object
 * views and `AppHeader` already populate, and kicks the fetch itself when the
 * type is still `idle` (`MetadataProvider`'s `readType`). No consumer of this
 * hook adds a request; the point is to remove one.
