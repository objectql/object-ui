 *
 * #4289 — one missing-resource answer used to retire the inbox feed for the
 * whole page, and BOTH panels with it.
 *
 * ## What the card recorded, and what had moved under it
 *
 * #4289 was filed against `AppHeader`'s own poll: a `notificationsUnavailableRef`
 * that latched on one 404 and was cleared by nothing — while `useHomeInbox`,
 * reading the same object with the same filter, simply retried. One transient
 * missing-resource answer therefore reproduced the #4110 / #4230 three-way
 * signature (bell empty under both filters, Home's card correct, no requests on
 * open) from a cause nobody was looking for.
 *
 * That poll no longer exists — #4225 / PR #4327 deleted it and pointed both
 * surfaces at `sharedUserFeeds`' inbox feed. The asymmetry the card described is
 * gone, but it closed in the WRONG DIRECTION: the surviving reader is the
 * latching one. `markUnavailable()` set `unavailable = true`, and `refresh()`,
 * `schedule()` and `onVisibilityChange()` all returned early on it, so nothing
 * short of a key change (a different user or adapter) or a page reload could
 * revive the feed. A remount did not; returning to the tab did not; a later
 * successful read never happened because no later read was issued. The blast
 * radius grew rather than shrank: the bell and Home's action centre now die
 * together, and the "Home still works" contrast that made the old signature
 * diagnosable is no longer available to whoever triages the next report.
 *
 * ## Why a transient 404 is reachable — the predicate is STATUS-shaped
 *
 * `isMissingResource` is `httpStatus === 404 || status === 404 ||
 * errorCodeIs(err, 'OBJECT_NOT_FOUND')`, and its two status arms are already
 * pinned true WITHOUT any error code
 * (`sharedUserFeeds.isMissingResource.test.ts`, "is true for a plain `status`
 * 404 as well"). The ObjectStack client stamps `error.httpStatus = res.status`
 * on every non-ok response before it inspects the body at all
 * (`packages/client/src/index.ts`), so a 404 produced ANYWHERE in the transport
 * — an edge router or reverse proxy with no healthy upstream mid-deploy, a host
 * answering its catch-all for `/api/v1/data/...` before the API is mounted —
 * arrives here indistinguishable from the registry's considered
 * `404 OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`. Only the second population is the answer #4315 ruled
 * on; the first is a lost race that used to cost the session its inbox.
 *
 * ## What these pin
 *
 * A bounded recovery, and the bound. Retirement keeps its meaning — the poll
 * stops, the status stays `ready`, the affirmative empty copy stays earned —
 * but a retired feed re-probes at most `UNAVAILABLE_PROBE_LIMIT` times, no more
 * often than `UNAVAILABLE_PROBE_MS`, and any of those probes that answers with
 * rows brings the feed (and both panels) back. A deployment that genuinely has
 * no messaging pipeline pays those few reads once and is then silent for the
 * rest of the page, which is the noise argument the retirement was built on.
 *
 * Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running, measured in this PR):
 *   - the recovery cases are RED on `origin/main` — the feed never re-reads, so
 *     the rows waiting behind the transient 404 are never seen;
 *   - the "identical UX" control is GREEN on `origin/main` and stays green: a
 *     permanently-missing object still answers `ready` with an empty value and
 *     never renders an error, before and after;
 *   - the "spends its budget and then stops" case is RED on `origin/main` in the
 *     OPPOSITE direction from the recovery cases — main issues FEWER reads (1)
 *     than the bound, not more. It is the noise ceiling, so it has to be able to
 *     fail upward; that it also fails downward today is what makes it evidence
 *     that the probes exist at all rather than a tautology.
