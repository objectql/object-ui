/**
 * `useApproverDirectory` reads a `find()` answer as `QueryResult` DECLARES it
 * — and rejects the two spellings it does not (objectui#5945).
 *
 * `QueryResult` (`@object-ui/types`) declares exactly one rows member: `data`.
 * Before this pin the module's `asArray` read
 *
 *     Array.isArray(res) ? res : res?.records ?? res?.items ?? res?.data ?? []
 *
 * — trying `records` and `items` FIRST and the contract's `data` only third.
 * Measured on this tree, no producer emits either at this seam
 * (`ObjectStackAdapter.normalizeQueryResult` maps the server's `records`
 * envelope to `data` before returning; `items` has no producer at all), so the
 * two arms bought nothing and cost the contract its authority: a raw SDK client
 * handed in where a `DataSource` belongs would have kept working, unnoticed and
 * unrejected, as a second de-facto contract (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * The bare-array arm is NOT removed and is pinned here too, because it is live:
 * fakes at this seam answer with a plain array (`AssignedUsersSection.test.tsx`
 * is one). Live and dead is the whole distinction — this file measures both
 * directions so neither can drift.
