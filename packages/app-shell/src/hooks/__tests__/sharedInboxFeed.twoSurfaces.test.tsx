 *
 * #4225 / #4316 — the bell and Home's action centre, driven from ONE inbox feed.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * Two consumers read `sys_inbox_message` on `/home`, and they asked different
 * questions of it. The bell's poll joined `sys_notification_receipt` for
 * read-state; `useHomeInbox` did not join anything. So Home could not tell a
 * read message from an unread one and listed the five most recent
 * unconditionally, badged — while the bell two hundred pixels above, reading
 * the same rows through the join, correctly showed zero unread (#4316). One
 * page load, two panels, opposite claims about the same messages.
 *
 * ## What these pin
 *
 * Both surfaces now derive from `sharedUserFeeds`' inbox feed, so the pins here
 * are deliberately *joint*: every case mounts the real `AppHeader` and the real
 * `HomeActionCenter` in ONE tree over ONE fake adapter and asserts what BOTH
 * show. That is the difference between "the bug is fixed" and "the bug has no
 * representable state left" — a future change that re-splits the read has to
 * make these two panels disagree to get past them, which is exactly the failure
 * mode being locked out.
 *
 * Reverse verification (predictions first, measured in PR #4319):
 *   - restore `useHomeInbox`'s own unjoined read ⇒ the #4316 block goes red
 *     (Home lists read messages the bell is not badging) and the one-read block
 *     goes red (two `sys_inbox_message` reads instead of one);
 *   - drop only the `!m.is_read` filter ⇒ the #4316 block goes red, the
 *     one-read block stays GREEN — which is why the read-count pin cannot stand
 *     in for the read-state pin, and both are here.
 *
 * ## #4329 — one question, one number
 *
 * Read-state was only half of "the two surfaces agree". The other half is HOW
 * MANY: Home badged `pendingApprovalsCount + notifications.length`, and
 * `notifications` is the list it renders — which `useHomeInbox` caps at 5. So
 * with nine unread the bell said 9 and the card two hundred pixels below said
 * 5, for the same question about the same rows. The badge was reporting the
 * size of a preview as if it were a total.
 *
 * The badge now counts unread TOPICS through `groupNotifications` — the bell's
 * own fold, over the bell's own rows — while the list stays capped. Badge =
 * "how much is waiting", list = "the newest few of it": two semantics, each
 * truthful, one number.
 *
 * Reverse verification (predictions first, measured in PR #4344):
 *   - restore `total = pendingApprovalsCount + notifications.length` ⇒ the
 *     #4329 block goes red (Home badges its capped 5 against the bell's 9) and
 *     the whole #4316 read-state block stays GREEN — the cap and the join are
 *     different defects and neither pin stands in for the other;
 *   - count the pre-slice list length instead of the topic fold (title-folded,
 *     blank titles dropped) ⇒ every case here stays green EXCEPT
 *     "counts unread TOPICS, not the titles the list happens to show", which is
 *     the only fixture where the two folds disagree — that case is why the
 *     count is taken from `groupNotifications` rather than re-derived.
