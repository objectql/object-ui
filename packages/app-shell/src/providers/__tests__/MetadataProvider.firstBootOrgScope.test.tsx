/**
 * objectui#5243 — the seed entry a FIRST-BOOT browser writes must be readable
 * by the boot that follows it.
 *
 * ## The window
 *
 * `activeOrgScope()` reads `ActiveOrganizationStorage`, which `AuthProvider`
 * only stamps after `getSession` → `listOrganizations` → `getActiveOrganization`
 * resolve. The eager `app` fetch starts at mount and lands first, so on a
 * browser that has never signed in the entry is written under `@none` while
 * every LATER boot computes the real org id — the seed misses forever after,
 * and the `@none` entry is orphaned in `sessionStorage` until the tab closes.
 *
 * ## Why the #4486 pins never saw it
 *
 * `primeCacheFor` in `MetadataProvider.orgScopedCache.test.tsx` stamps the org
 * id BEFORE the first render, which models a RETURNING browser — correctly, for
 * what those pins are about. The window here only exists when storage is empty
 * AT MOUNT and the org arrives afterwards, so the modelling below is the whole
 * point: `firstBoot()` renders with both storages empty and stamps the org only
 * after the app fetch has already landed.
 *
 * ## Why re-keying is sound here (the objectui#5243 tenant-header check)
 *
 * That first fetch goes out with NO `X-Tenant-ID`, because
 * `createAuthenticatedFetch` reads the same empty storage. It does not matter:
 * the server never reads that header for tenant scoping. `resolveAuthzContext`
 * takes `tenantId` from `session.activeOrganizationId` and nothing else
 * (framework `packages/core/src/security/resolve-authz-context.ts`, pinned by
 * `packages/verify/src/harness.org-context.test.ts`: "`session.activeOrganizationId`
 * is the ONE field `resolveAuthzContext` reads into `tenantId`"), and the
 * environment chain reads only the hostname and `X-Environment-Id`. So the
 * response cached under `@none` was computed for exactly the organization
 * `AuthProvider` is about to stamp — the entry is correctly SCOPED and merely
 * mislabelled, which is what makes moving the label the right repair rather
 * than a relabelling of someone else's answer.
