/**
 * objectui#4486 — metadata the provider caches belongs to ONE organization.
 *
 * ## The invariant
 *
 * After an org switch, a `useMetadata().apps` read in the seed window must not
 * return the previous organization's list. That is deliberately stated about
 * the DATA, not about the storage key: a re-keying that still served stale
 * items by some other path would satisfy a key-string assertion and violate the
 * card. So nothing here asserts what the key looks like — the cache is filled
 * by running the provider, and every assertion reads the value a consumer
 * actually gets back.
 *
 * ## Why the seed window is where this bites
 *
 * `MetadataProvider` seeds the app list from `sessionStorage` before the
 * org-scoped fetch returns, and `sessionStorage` survives the full-page
 * navigation `WorkspaceSwitcher.handleSwitch` performs after
 * `switchOrganization` resolves. The seed used to be keyed by metadata TYPE
 * alone (`objectui:metadata:app`), so the first thing the new org's console did
 * was resolve against the old org's apps — which is how a fresh-workspace
 * member got aimed at `/apps/setup` (objectui#4473, patched downstream by
 * PR #4483's bounce; the provider is the mechanism and this is it).
 *
 * `RootLandingRedirect` was merely the consumer that got caught. ~15 surfaces
 * read `useMetadata().apps` (sidebar, app switcher, search, home, inbox…), so
 * the pin belongs at the provider, not at any one of them.
 *
 * ## The two halves, pinned separately
 *
 * 1. Cross-org staleness — the seed is scoped to the active organization, and
 *    the in-memory cache is dropped when the active org changes WITHOUT a
 *    reload (`OrganizationLayout` does exactly that from an effect).
 * 2. Truthy-empty short-circuit — a cached `[]` is truthy, so it used to clear
 *    `initialLoading` too, making "no apps (cached, possibly stale)"
 *    indistinguishable from "no apps (fresh)".
 *
 * The third test is the counter-pin: deleting the cache outright would satisfy
 * (1) and (2) and destroy the optimization, so a same-org remount must still
 * seed instantly.
