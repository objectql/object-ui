/**
 * Type-level pin for objectui#6551 — the cast `buildExpressionUser` reads its
 * input through is not WIDER than the contract it mirrors.
 *
 * ## What the defect was, and why only the compiler can see it
 *
 * The normaliser's signed-in branch forwards `id` / `name` / `email` RAW, out
 * of a cast that declared all three optional:
 *
 *     const u = user as { id?: string; name?: string; email?: string; … }
 *
 * So the declaration said a session with no `id` was a legitimate input, and
 * the code answered `{ id: undefined, … }` for it — present-and-always-
 * `undefined`, the exact shape objectui#5424 removed `roles` from this object
 * for and objectui#6534 refused for the anonymous branch one key over. The
 * contract it mirrors disagrees: `useAuth().user` is `@object-ui/auth`'s
 * `AuthUser`, which extends the spec's `AuthUser` — `id: string;
 * email: string; name: string`, with only `positions` / `tenantId` optional.
 *
 * NOTHING REACHABLE TODAY HITS IT. The only production input is a better-auth
 * principal that always carries `id`, which is why this card was graded a
 * latent shape hazard and why the fix moved a DECLARATION and no runtime
 * behaviour. That is also why no runtime assertion can pin it: `id?: string`
 * and `id: string` produce byte-identical output for every input a producer
 * can actually supply. The compiler is the only instrument that sees the
 * difference, so this file drives `tsc` itself — same mechanism as
 * `core/src/utils/__tests__/freeze-schema.types.test.ts` and
 * `core/src/actions/__tests__/actionKeys.types.test.ts` (vitest's `typecheck`
 * mode is off in `vitest.config.mts`; turning it on is a shared-config change
 * owned by objectui#3181, not by this card).
 *
 * NO BUILD ARTIFACT SITS BETWEEN THE EDIT AND THESE ASSERTIONS. The preamble
 * imports `../expressionUser` by relative path, so the program reads the
 * SOURCE file — and that module is a LEAF that imports nothing, so there is no
 * workspace `dist` anywhere on the path that could go stale and degrade a type
 * to `any` (the hazard `actionKeys.types.test.ts` documents). `AuthUser` comes
 * from the PUBLISHED `@objectstack/spec` typings in `node_modules`, and the
 * preamble-integrity case below fails loudly if either import stops resolving,
 * rather than letting a silent `any` turn a rejection case green.
 *
 * ## Discrimination is built in, not promised
 *
 * Every case is compiled a SECOND time with one thing changed: the type
 * redeclared with its PRE-FIX optionality, verbatim from `main` at
 * `0235ce7c1`, everything else still the real module. `EXPECTED_FLIPS` names by
 * index exactly which cases that reverts. A case outside that set is green on
 * BOTH legs and is stated as such rather than quietly counted as evidence —
 * three of the cases below are in that position deliberately, because "the
 * narrowing did not overshoot" is a claim that needs its own controls.
 *
 * ## Fenced boundary
 *
 * `id: u.id ?? null` is the REJECTED shape (triage ruling, 2026-08-26): a
 * lenient default in the consumer is what AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids and what
 * objectui#6534 shipped a scope fence against. The last case in the runtime
 * section is that fence made mechanical — it reds if a fallback is smuggled in
 * later. Changing it is re-deciding the card, not editing a test.
