 * objectui#6515 — the SHAPE pin objectui#6110's contract implies but never got.
 *
 * ## What went wrong, and why nothing caught it
 *
 * objectui#6110 exported `buildExpressionUser` so that "every console surface
 * that mounts the provider publishes the SAME `current_user` shape", and said
 * in as many words that a second mount site re-deriving the shape by hand
 * "would reintroduce exactly the asymmetry #6010's parity pin exists to
 * refuse". `RecordFormPage` was such a site and did exactly that:
 *
 *     { name, email, role, positions }        // the hand-rolled descriptor
 *
 * — no `id`, no `isPlatformAdmin`. Both are named by real gates
 * (`ctx.user.isPlatformAdmin == true` on `sys_environment`'s "Change Plan
 * (admin)"; `record.id == ctx.user.id` throughout `sys_user`). An ABSENT key is
 * not `false`: the predicate FAULTS, and `evaluateVisibility` fails OPEN on a
 * fault, so an admin-only field rendered for every user with nothing on screen
 * to say the gate had not bitten. objectui#6493 fixed which ROOTS were bound on
 * this page; it did not touch the SHAPE of the object bound under them.
 *
 * Every pin that existed asserted the normaliser's own output
 * (`AppContent.expressionUserShape.test.ts`). None asserted what a MOUNT SITE
 * publishes, so a site that never called the normaliser was invisible to all of
 * them.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why "shape" and not "was it called"
 *
 * The probe sits INSIDE the page's own `ExpressionProvider` and reads the
 * predicate scope that provider actually publishes — the same
 * `PredicateScopeContext` `useCondition` / `useExpression` read at every
 * consumer. The assertion is `toStrictEqual(buildExpressionUser(session))` over
 * all four published spellings of the identity. That is a SHAPE comparison
 * against the normaliser's live output, so it fails for a site that hand-rolls
 * a descriptor whatever route it took to build it — including one that calls
 * the normaliser and then spreads extra keys over it, which a spy on the
 * function could not see. `toStrictEqual` (not `toEqual`) so a key written as
 * explicit `undefined` fails too: that is precisely the class of defect
 * objectui#5424 measured on this same object.
 *
 * `mountSites.ratchet.test.ts` is the other half — this file proves the shape
 * at the site it can render, that one refuses a NEW site that stops calling the
 * normaliser at all. Neither is sufficient alone.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running)
 *
 * Restore the hand-rolled descriptor in `RecordFormPage`:
 *   - both parity cases go RED on the missing `id` / `isPlatformAdmin`;
 *   - `hides an isPlatformAdmin-gated field from a non-admin` goes RED as
 *     `toContain` — the fault fails OPEN, so the field is PRESENT;
 *   - the same for the signed-IN `ctx.user.id` case, and for the signed-out
 *     `isPlatformAdmin` case;
 *   - `hides a ctx.user.id-gated field from a signed-out visitor` stays GREEN
 *     both ways — it measures the normaliser's own anonymous branch, which
 *     THIS card does not touch. (It was named `RECORDS: a ctx.user.id gate
 *     STILL fails open for a signed-out visitor` and asserted the opposite
 *     until objectui#6534 fixed that branch; see the case body.)
 *   - `grants ... to a platform admin` stays GREEN — fail-open and a correct
 *     `true` are indistinguishable at the call site, which is the whole reason
 *     the excluded-user cases carry the pin.
