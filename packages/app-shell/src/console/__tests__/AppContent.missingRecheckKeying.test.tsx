/**
 * The post-publish readiness re-check belongs to the app it ran for
 * (objectui#4522).
 *
 * ## The measured defect
 *
 * `AppContent` re-checks metadata once when a requested app is absent, because
 * "the registry can lag a beat behind a publish" — that refresh is what lets a
 * just-built app resolve on its own instead of flashing "App not available".
 * The state driving it recorded only THAT a re-check had run, never WHICH app
 * it ran for, and it was reset on exactly one condition: `requestedAppMissing`
 * going false.
 *
 * Two missing apps in a row never satisfy that condition. `requestedAppMissing`
 * is true before the transition and true after it, so the state stayed `'done'`
 * across the navigation and the SECOND app got no re-check at all: a freshly
 * published app reached second in one mount (launcher -> typo'd URL -> the real
 * app; or two attempts while a build lands) showed the not-available screen with
 * no refresh behind it. Retry still worked, which is why the cost is one skipped
 * refresh rather than a wrong screen.
 *
 * ## Why these cases are written as a NAVIGATION, not as two mounts
 *
 * A case that mounts with a single missing app and asserts one refresh passes
 * against the defect — a fresh mount starts from idle, so the skipped re-check
 * is invisible to it. The failure only exists ACROSS a transition inside one
 * mount, so every case here drives the navigation through the router
 * (`useNavigate`, same `<Route element>`, params change and the component
 * instance is kept) and asserts a SECOND `refreshMetadata`. That the state is
 * genuinely shared across the transition is what the red run proves: pre-fix
 * these cases fail precisely because `AppContent` kept its first app's state.
 *
 * ## The keying mirrors the sibling one state over
 *
 * PR #4521 (objectui#4252) hit the same shape with the access probe in this
 * file and stored the verdict WITH the app it describes, reading it back only
 * for that app. Same pattern here rather than a second style — see
 * `AppContent.deniedVsUnpublished.test.tsx` for that half.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCOPE: this file measures WHICH SURFACE renders and WHEN the re-check
 * runs. `ConsoleLayout` and the lazy pages are stubbed; none of their internals
 * are part of the question (same approach as
 * `AppContent.inaccessibleAppStrand.test.tsx`).
