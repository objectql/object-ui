/**
 * objectui#6507 — the `AppContent` boot bounce, and the control that keeps the
 * conversion honest.
 *
 * ## The two arms
 *
 * `bootRedirectCoverage.test.tsx` states the probe in full: hold the
 * destination un-painted, then ask whether the app tree holds anything for the
 * viewport to show at the commit where the gate DECIDES. This file runs that
 * same probe on the two populations that only exist inside `AppContent`:
 *
 *   SUBJECT — the no-accessible-app bounce (`AppContent.tsx`, the
 *   `!activeApp && … && !isWorkspaceAdmin` branch). Every readiness gate above
 *   it renders `LoadingScreen`, and the branch returns ABOVE the single
 *   `ConsoleLayout` mount, so what it hands off to is the whole viewport.
 *
 *   CONTROL — `LegacyMetadataRedirect`, one of the five URL-rewrite redirects
 *   the #6507 triage ruling names as OUT of shape. It is declared INSIDE
 *   `ConsoleLayout`, so it fires with the console already painted. It must read
 *   "covered" with no change to this codebase, and it must keep reading
 *   "covered" after the subject converts — converting it would hand it a splash
 *   it never had, which is the failure mode the ruling bans.
 *
 * The control is not decoration. Without it, "the tree was empty" is a claim
 * the probe could make about every redirect in the repository; with it, the
 * probe is shown to distinguish the two populations the ruling turns on.
