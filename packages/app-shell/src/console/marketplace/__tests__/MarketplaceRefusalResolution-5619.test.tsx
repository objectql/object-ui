/**
 * Neither marketplace page may refuse a viewer on a verdict that has not
 * resolved (objectui#5619).
 *
 * ## Why this suite mounts, rather than type-checks
 *
 * The defect is a RENDER-ORDERING artefact: the hook's inputs arrive in two
 * waves and the page decides on the first one. Nothing static can see that —
 * a green type-check is satisfied by any page that reads the new pair, whether
 * or not it acts on it. So each case renders the real page, reads the FRAME the
 * unresolved verdict produces, then flips the verdict and reads the frame
 * again. The assertion is the pair of frames.
 *
 * ## Why both pages, and why the negatives are here
 *
 * These two are the card's REFUSAL surfaces: they paint
 * `MarketplaceAccessDenied` — an access-denied screen at a real administrator,
 * which is the severe half of the split triage kept. `MarketplacePackagePage`'s
 * package fetch used to mask the window incidentally, for as long as an
 * unrelated request happened to take; objectui#5621 correctly removed that, so
 * both pages now reach the window with nothing in front of them.
 *
 * The negatives matter as much as the positive: a "fix" that simply stopped
 * refusing, or that held the resolving frame forever, would satisfy the first
 * case in each pair. `a settled non-admin is still refused` and `the
 * runtime-off answer still comes first` are what make that substitution fail —
 * the second one because objectui#5557/#5533 put `!marketplaceEnabled` ahead of
 * the privilege answer deliberately, and a guard inserted in the wrong place
 * would silently retire that ordering.
