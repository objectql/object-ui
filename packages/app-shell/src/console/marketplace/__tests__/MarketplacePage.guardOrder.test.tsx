/**
 * The catalog page answers "this runtime has no marketplace" BEFORE it answers
 * "you are not an admin" (objectui#5557).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `MarketplacePage` ordered its early returns admin-first:
 *
 *     if (!isAdmin) return (MarketplaceAccessDenied)
 *     if (!marketplaceEnabled) return (MarketplaceDisabled)
 *
 * so on an `OS_CLOUD_URL=off` deployment — the EE deploy template's factory
 * default — an unprivileged member was told they lack PERMISSION for a surface
 * that exists for nobody. That answer sends them to ask an administrator for a
 * grant that would not help them, and it left the disabled state objectui#5504
 * built unreachable for every non-admin. `MarketplacePackagePage` had already
 * been reordered under objectui#5533, so the two sibling pages disagreed about
 * one runtime for exactly one class of viewer.
 *
 * Its detail-page legs were written against an ordering that has since been
 * retired: objectui#5583 moved that page's `!isAdmin` guard ahead of its
 * `loading` and `error || !data` branches, so it no longer needs a package to
 * resolve before it can refuse anyone. The legs below now compare both pages'
 * answers from config and privilege alone, which is what "the same kind of
 * answer" was always meant to mean.
 *
 * ## Why a separate suite from `MarketplacePage.disabledState.test.tsx`
 *
 * That suite pins WHERE the disabled state comes from, and hard-mocks
 * `useWorkspaceAdminStatus: () => ({ isAdmin: true, isResolved: true })` at module scope — every case in it is an
 * admin, so none of them can see this defect. The admin flag has to vary per
 * case here, which is a different module mock and therefore a different file.
 *
 * ## Why these cases boot the REAL runtime-config module
 *
 * Same argument the sibling suites make: the disabled state's correctness is
 * *where it comes from*. It comes from `features.marketplace`, which the server
 * derives per request from its own route table (objectstack#8356) — never from
 * the shape of a failure. So every case boots the genuine `initRuntimeConfig()`
 * over a stubbed `GET /api/v1/runtime/config` and lets the real merge run.
 *
 * ## The control that makes the rest load-bearing
 *
 * objectui#5557 explicitly does NOT claim admin-first ordering is wrong in
 * general. On a runtime that DOES mount a marketplace, a non-admin must still
 * get access-denied — the catalog is an install surface. Without that boundary
 * case, a "fix" that simply deleted the admin check would satisfy every other
 * assertion in this file while handing an install surface to every member.
