/**
 * ONE `code` -> message mapping for every server-echoed organization error
 * (objectui#4474).
 *
 * ## The stable half of the pair
 *
 * better-auth answers a refused organization call with BOTH an English sentence
 * and a machine `code` (`ORGANIZATION_ALREADY_EXISTS`,
 * `YOU_ARE_NOT_THE_RECIPIENT_OF_THE_INVITATION`, …). Only the code is stable:
 * the sentence is a third party's copy, free to be reworded in any release. So
 * this maps the code and never reads the text. Translating by matching the
 * English would go silently English again the day upstream rewrites a string,
 * with no test able to see it — which is the failure mode the ruling forbids by
 * name.
 *
 * ## The code has to survive the client boundary to be readable here
 *
 * It did not, before this change. `packages/auth/src/createAuthClient.ts` had a
 * `toAuthError` helper that preserves `code` — used by sign-in and sign-up only —
 * while every `organization.*` method threw `new Error(error.message ?? '…')` and
 * dropped it. The three sites in the card therefore held an English sentence and
 * nothing else, so no consumer-side cleverness short of string matching could
 * have localized them. That producer now routes through `toAuthError` too; this
 * module is the consumer half, and the two are useless apart.
 *
 * ## Prefer mapped, degrade to verbatim
 *
 * The shape mirrors what `LoginForm`/`RegisterForm` already do —
 * `(code && map[code]) || error.message`. An unmapped code still shows the
 * server's own sentence: English is worse than Chinese and far better than a
 * blank box or a generic "something went wrong", both of which delete the only
 * diagnostic the user has. Never swallow an error.
 *
 * ## Why these eight codes and not better-auth's sixty
 *
 * Every row is a rejection the five console files under
 * `console/organizations/` can actually provoke — the three the card measured,
 * plus five siblings on the same three call paths (the role-cap refusal that
 * `invitableOrgRoles` narrows for but the server re-checks; a duplicate invite;
 * the slug collision that is the create dialog's other outcome; the
 * multi-org-disabled refusal `CreateWorkspaceDialog` already comments about; and
 * the expired link `AcceptInvitationPage` already has a hand-written fallback
 * for). The other ~50 are teams, dynamic roles and org surfaces this console has
 * no screen for. Each row costs ten pack translations, and an unlisted code
 * already degrades correctly, so the cost of omitting one is bounded and the
 * cost of speculating is not.
