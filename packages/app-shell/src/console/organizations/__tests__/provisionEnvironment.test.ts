/**
 * provisionProductionEnvironment — born-with-env contract.
 *
 *   - posts `Production` + the explicit org id to the cloud env endpoint;
 *   - resolves the created env on 2xx, reading it from the NESTED `environment`
 *     row the control plane wraps it in (objectui#6629), and REFUSES a 2xx
 *     whose `data` carries no such row (objectui#6707);
 *   - treats 403/409 ("org already has its production env" — e.g. the control
 *     plane's auto-default-environment plugin won the race) as SUCCESS
 *     (`alreadyProvisioned`), NOT a failure;
 *   - throws only on a genuine failure (5xx) so the caller can fall back to the
 *     lazy onboarding gate.
