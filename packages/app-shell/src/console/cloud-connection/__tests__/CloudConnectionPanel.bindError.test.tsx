 * objectui#5028 — what the bind-failure surface actually shows a human, and
 * from which of the panel's TWO failure readers it comes.
 *
 * The card asked for one call site to stop preferring a machine code:
 * `poll()`'s terminal branch read `body?.error?.code ?? t(...)`, while
 * `getJson()` fifty lines above already reads `message ?? code ?? error`. That
 * change is made and pinned below.
 *
 * ## The card's SYMPTOM claim does not survive verification
 *
 * The card predicted that after objectstack#9267 / PR #9369 a user would see
 * `DEVICE_CODE_FAILED` where they previously saw `expired_token`, i.e. that the
 * device-authorization failure is displayed by the `poll()` branch. It is not.
 * That envelope is served with HTTP **400**
 * (`packages/cloud-connection/src/cloud-connection-plugin.ts`, the `/bind/poll`
 * terminal exit — 400 before PR #9369 and 400 after it), and `getJson` throws
 * on any non-2xx whose body is not `success: true`. So the string a user reads
 * for an expired or denied device code has always come from `getJson`'s
 * precedence, which already preferred `message` — the upstream fix reached the
 * UI the moment it merged, with no change needed here.
 *
 * The first case below is the CONTROL that pins exactly that, so the next
 * reader is not sent looking for this text in `poll()`.
 *
 * ## What is genuinely reached by the changed line
 *
 * `poll()`'s terminal branch runs only for a body `getJson` hands BACK, i.e. a
 * 2xx, that then says neither `data.pending` nor `data.bound` nor
 * `success: true`. `/bind/poll` has exactly one such exit: it returns the
 * control plane's own `/bind` answer verbatim, `c.json(bindJson,
 * bindResp.status)`. A control plane answering 200 with `success: false` — an
 * envelope violation on its side, and precisely the population objectstack#9364
 * is still counting — lands here, and this is where a code used to be rendered
 * instead of the sentence beside it.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running)
 *
 *   - Revert the line to `code ?? t(...)`: case 2 RED (reads
 *     `ENVIRONMENT_BIND_FAILED` where the sentence was expected), cases 3 and 4
 *     GREEN (no `message` to prefer), case 1 GREEN — it never used this line.
 *   - Invert the chain to `code ?? message ?? t(...)`: case 2 RED for the same
 *     reason, 1/3/4 GREEN. Only case 2 can tell the two orders apart, because
 *     it is the only fixture that carries both halves.
