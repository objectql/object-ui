/**
 * A pick made the instant the options appear is never overwritten by
 * auto-select-first (objectstack#6979).
 *
 * A context selector is a *mandatory* scope, so `SelectorControl` auto-selects
 * `options[0]` as soon as the option list resolves and nothing concrete is
 * selected. That repair used to run in a passive effect — i.e. in a task AFTER
 * the commit that rendered the options — which left a gap with a rendered,
 * clickable dropdown in it and no selection yet. A pick delivered inside that
 * gap was applied and then immediately navigated away again, because the
 * queued auto-select fired second with a closure captured before the pick
 * (`hasConcrete` still `false`, and the search string it wrote from still the
 * pre-pick one). The user's choice silently became `options[0]`.
 *
 * The gap is not a test artefact: a click on a loaded machine or a slow device
 * lands in whatever task the event loop gives it, and nothing a test does can
 * make a real user wait for React's passive effects. What the tests below add is
 * the ability to *aim* at the gap deterministically, so the regression is pinned
 * by a red assertion instead of by CI's luck.
 *
 * ## Why the raw MutationObserver instead of `waitFor`
 *
 * RTL's async wrapper drains a macrotask after the callback first succeeds, so
 * `await waitFor(optionRowsExist)` usually returns on the far side of the gap —
 * which is exactly why this bug read as flaky rather than broken, and why the
 * sibling `ContextSelectors.persist.test.tsx` cases can settle-then-click and be
 * stable. {@link atOptionsCommit} stops at the commit that adds the option rows,
 * with the post-commit work still outstanding, so the click below lands inside
 * the gap on every machine.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted before running)
 *
 * Turning `SelectorControl`'s auto-select back into `React.useEffect` turns both
 * medium cases red *immediately* — not by timeout: the clobber happens inside
 * the click's own `act`, so the control comes back from `fireEvent.click`
 * already showing `billing`, and the synchronous assertion right after the click
 * is the one that fires. (Measured: `expected 'billing' to be 'crm_core'`, the
 * same message as the two CI runs in objectstack#6979.) The third case is the
 * opposite direction — it stays green across that revert, because it pins the
 * behaviour the fix must NOT change: it is the guard against "fix the race by
 * latching auto-select off after the first pick", which would leave the scope
 * blank the next time a nav link drops the param (objectstack#5994 deleted the
 * storage → URL bridge on the strength of that re-selection).
