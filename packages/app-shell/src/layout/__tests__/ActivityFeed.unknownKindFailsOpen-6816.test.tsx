 *
 * objectui#6816 — `ActivityFeed`'s notification filter read an unrecognised
 * kind as "off".
 *
 * `activities.filter(a => notificationPreferences[a.type])` is a truthiness
 * test over a `Record<ActivityItemType, boolean>`, so it answers the same
 * `false` to two different questions:
 *
 *  - the kind IS in the record and the user toggled it off — hide the row,
 *    which is the feature;
 *  - the kind is ABSENT from the record — which made the row VANISH.
 *
 * In-repo `tsc` keeps that second case out of reach (three exhaustive
 * `Record<ActivityItemType, …>` tables), but `ActivityFeed` is published API
 * — exported from the package barrel at `src/index.ts` — and a host that
 * mounts it can pass a kind that came from its own data. `sys_activity.type`
 * is author-extensible (objectstack#11507, ruled 2026-08-24), so those kinds
 * exist. The failure mode was a missing row: stored, queryable, invisible.
 *
 * These pin BOTH directions, because either one alone is satisfiable by a
 * broken filter: fail-open alone passes on a filter that shows everything,
 * and still-filtered alone passes on the defect itself.
