/**
 * App Switcher — filters on `hidden`, and ⛔ must NOT filter on `_unpublished`
 * (objectstack#6955, the objectui half of the #4829 A1 ruling).
 *
 * This is the negative half of the same card that flips `UnpublishedAppBar` to
 * `_unpublished`. The tempting symmetry — "the banner moved to the new key, so
 * the launcher should too" — is explicitly wrong, and the reason is a layering
 * one, not a preference:
 *
 *   • `_unpublished` is enforced SERVER-SIDE. The REST metadata gate already
 *     withholds unpublished apps from non-builders, so an unpublished app that
 *     reaches this component at all is one the viewer is entitled to see —
 *     a builder, looking at their own in-progress app. Filtering it out here
 *     would hide the builder's app from the builder, in the one client surface
 *     they use to navigate to it, while the server was already handling every
 *     viewer who should not see it. Duplicating a server gate in the client
 *     buys nothing and can only ever be wrong in the strict direction.
 *
 *   • `hidden` is enforced NOWHERE ELSE, by design. It is an author-declared
 *     navigation-presentation choice ("Hidden apps stay fully routable and
 *     permission-checked" — framework PR #6942), so this filter IS its whole
 *     implementation. Dropping it would put the `account` app back in the
 *     top-level switcher.
 *
 * Hence: two keys, two different enforcement points, and this component reads
 * exactly one of them.
