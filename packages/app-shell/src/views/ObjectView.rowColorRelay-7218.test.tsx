/**
 * objectui#7218 — the object page relays a per-view `rowColor`.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `renderListView` builds `fullSchema` by spreading the OBJECT's `listSchema`
 * and then relaying 47 named keys off the active `viewDef`. `label`,
 * `description`, `color`, `conditionalFormatting`, `fieldTextColor` and the
 * rest each have a rung. `rowColor` had NONE, so `schema.rowColor` at the
 * `ListView` end could only ever be whatever arrived on the host's list schema,
 * and a per-view row colour was unreachable — authored, validated, built and
 * served correctly, then dropped here.
 *
 * Same shape as objectui#7199's `description`, and this file is that file's
 * sibling by construction: nothing errors, every authoring gate passes, and the
 * only symptom is that rows the author asked to be coloured are not.
 *
 * ## Why this is a relay and not an intent question
 *
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/InterfaceListPage.tsx` — the interface route,
 * the third host — already relays `rowColor: view.rowColor` into a schema typed
 * `ListViewSchema`, alongside `grouping` and `pagination`, with no fence of any
 * kind. `rowColor` is a declared member of `ListViewSchema` (by-reference from
 * `@objectstack/spec`) and `ListView` reads it to seed `rowColorConfig`. So the
 * delivery path exists and is in use; this route simply did not take it.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT `userActions.rowColor`, which is a different key at a different
 * nesting level that shares a name: a BOOLEAN permission toggle ("may the user
 * open the colour panel"), folded from the legacy `showColor` flag by
 * `normalizeListViewSchema` and asserted by that fold's own tests. This card is
 * the row-colour CONFIGURATION ("what the colours are"). The `userActions`
 * relay above is untouched by this change, and the last case holds the two
 * apart so a crossed wire fails instead of passing.
 *
 * ## The value DOES arrive here — the relay is where it dies
 *
 * `buildViewTabs` composes each entry through `viewEntry`, which is
 * `Object.assign` over the authored body and stamps only `id` afterwards. No
 * key whitelist runs between `objectDef.listViews` and `activeView`, so an
 * authored `rowColor` is present on `viewDef` and this relay is the single
 * point of loss.
 *
 * ## Direction and counts, written before the run (reverse verification)
 *
 * Deleting the `rowColor:` rung from `fullSchema` was PREDICTED to turn the
 * three view-authored cases RED (`captured.rowColor` `undefined`, or the
 * host-level value where the view's own was expected) and to leave the three
 * fallback/absence/`userActions` controls GREEN — they resolve through the
 * `...listSchema` spread and the untouched `userActions` fold, neither of which
 * the rung touches. Predicted 3 red / 3 passing.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURED 4 red / 2 passing, and the prediction was the thing that was
 * wrong. The last case is not a pure control: it asserts the config rung AND
 * the untouched toggle in ONE render, so it carries a FIX limb and goes red
 * with the other three. The two limbs are kept together on purpose — holding
 * the two same-named keys apart is only meaningful when both are read off the
 * same relayed schema — so the case stays as written.
 *
 * ⛔ The predicted line above is left EXACTLY as it was written before the run,
 * annotated rather than corrected: a prediction edited to agree with its result
 * is no longer evidence of anything. The gap is a mislabelling in THIS file,
 * not a finding about the relay — the case was filed under "controls" while
 * asserting the fix — and the controls that are genuinely pure (the
 * `...listSchema` fallback and the absence case) did stay green in both states,
 * which is the property the prediction existed to check.
 *
 * ## Why the schema is captured rather than rendered
 *
 * The claim is about what THIS file hands down, so `ListView` is stubbed and
 * its `schema` prop recorded — the same posture as
 * `ObjectView.viewDescriptionRelay-7199.test.tsx`. Whether the captured value
 * then colours a row is `plugin-list`/`plugin-grid`'s half (`useRowColor`), and
 * is not re-pinned here.
