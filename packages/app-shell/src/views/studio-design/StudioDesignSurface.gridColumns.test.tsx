/**
 * The Data pillar's grid must not issue a duplicate find() on every render —
 * objectui#4567.
 *
 * Measured on origin/main: driving the pillar and forcing three re-renders that
 * change NOTHING (same object, same fields, same refresh signal) produced one
 * extra `find()` per render — 1 -> 4. The trigger is the IDENTITY of the columns
 * array, not its contents. Three legs, all on the path this suite drives:
 *
 *   1. producer — `StudioDesignSurface`'s object-view schema built
 *      `table.fields` with `readFields(objDraft.fields).entries.map().filter()`
 *      inline, allocating a fresh array on every render;
 *   2. forward — plugin-view's ObjectView hands that array to the
 *      `renderListView` slot as `columns` BY REFERENCE
 *      (plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx:997 — no map/filter of its own), and in
 *      design mode there is no saved view, so it falls through to
 *      `schema.table?.fields`;
 *   3. consumer — `ListView` derives `expandFields` from `schema.columns` with
 *      that array in the memo's dep array BY IDENTITY
 *      (plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx:1245-1294), and `expandFields` is itself in
 *      the fetch effect's dep array (:1609). A fresh array therefore refetches.
 *
 * The fix is identity stabilisation at the PRODUCER (leg 1). ListView's
 * by-identity dependency is correct for a real column change and is left
 * untouched — plugin-list is read-only here.
 *
 * This suite drives the REAL producer (`DataPillar`), not a reconstruction of
 * it: the defect is a property of how that component builds its schema, so a
 * harness that built its own array would measure the harness. That is also why
 * it is a separate file from `StudioDesignSurface.gridRefresh.test.tsx`
 * (objectui#4549), which drives the slot directly and hoists its own stable
 * `columns` to work around this very defect — those tests stay as they are.

   * Identity-churn liveness: the columns dependency must stay LIVE against a
   * FRESH ARRAY — not be defeated by a producer-side memo that freezes the
   * columns or constant-folds them. This pin is green before and after the
   * #4567 fix on purpose; it is a must-not-change, not a red-first case.
   *
   * ⚠️ What this case drives is NOT a content change, and this docstring used
   * to say that it was ("a REAL column change still refetches"). cloud#1652 is
   * what moved it out from under that sentence: `gridColumns` gained a trailing
   * `.filter((n) => publishedFieldNames.has(n))`, and `publishedFieldNames` is
   * read from the SERVER baseline alone (the `layered()` response), never from
   * the draft. "+ Add field" appends an UNPUBLISHED `field_<N>` to
   * `objDraft.fields`, so the memo recomputes — new `fields`, hence a new array
   * — and that same filter then removes `field_<N>` again. What reaches the grid
   * is therefore an array of EQUAL CONTENT carrying a FRESH IDENTITY.
   *
   * Measured on origin/main while correcting this docstring (objectui#6729):
   * across the click `find()` goes 1 -> 2 while `$select` is
   * `["id","name","status"]` both before and after, and no `field_` ever reaches
   * the projection. So the refetch asserted below can only have arrived through
   * the column-IDENTITY dependency chain — and there is no remount to explain it
   * either: the grid's key is `${current.name}:${gridVer}`, and `gridVer` does
   * not move.
   *
   * ⛔ Do not read this as covering "columns whose CONTENT changed must still
   * refetch". That case is real, and it is pinned elsewhere — plugin-list's
   * `ListView.discardedExpandFieldsMemo.test.tsx` (objectui#6697), which moves
   * `$select` while holding `$expand` byte-identical. Taking the old sentence at
   * face value already cost one round: #6697's implementer concluded the content
   * case was covered here, and had to add it there.
