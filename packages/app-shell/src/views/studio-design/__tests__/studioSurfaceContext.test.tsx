/* ── The `ai/conversations` double (objectui#7307) ────────────────────
 * Every `renderAt` below mounts the real `StudioCopilotConversation`, whose
 * `useChatConversation` resolve effect mints a thread for the signed-in user on
 * mount: `POST /api/v1/ai/conversations` through the GLOBAL `fetch`
 * (`hooks/useChatConversation.ts:609`, no `apiFetch` seam on the path). Under
 * happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL defaults to
 * `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live socket — once
 * per case, four in the file. The resolve's `catch` is deliberately conservative
 * (it keeps the surface as it was), which is why these cases stayed green while
 * the mint always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it
 * records every URL it is handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the
 * routes it serves.
 *
 * TWO routes, because a mint that SUCCEEDS is resumable and the hook resumes it.
 * `useChatConversation` caches the minted id in `localStorage`
 * (`writeCache` → `readCache`), and happy-dom keeps that store for the whole
 * file — so case 1 mints and cases 2-4 resume, reading
 * `GET /api/v1/ai/conversations/{THE_MINTED_ID}` instead. That second route was
 * MEASURED, not assumed: serving only the mint made this file's own
 * router assertion red naming that exact URL. Both answer the same empty
 * `ServerConversation` (`{ id, messages: [] }` — the shape `createConversation`
 * and `fetchConversation` both cast their body to), so the fake server is
 * self-consistent: one thread, minted once, resumed thereafter.
 *
 * Why an empty thread changes no assertion here: this file asserts ONE thing per
 * case — the `surfaceContext` prop the pane receives, derived from the URL alone.
 * `ChatPane` is a capture stub, the conversation never reaches an assertion, and
 * the resolve settles in a microtask AFTER each synchronous case body has already
 * read `capturedProps`. A SEEDED thread would hydrate `initialMessages` into that
 * same stub for no assertion's benefit. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME; the
 * full URL is what gets recorded.
