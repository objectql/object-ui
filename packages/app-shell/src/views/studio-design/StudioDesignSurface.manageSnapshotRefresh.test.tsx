/**
 * objectui#7907 — the TAIL of `onManageChanged` swallowed a failed
 * managed-snapshot refresh, so after a lifecycle action the open sheet
 * presented the PRE-ACTION record as current.
 *
 * `onManageChanged` runs after every lifecycle action fired from the
 * `PackageDetailSheet` (disable / enable / duplicate / publish /
 * publish-drafts / manifest edit). It has two halves: the HEAD refreshes the
 * package LIST (objectui#7821, fixed in PR #7879) and the TAIL re-reads the
 * managed record so the edit shows immediately. The tail was:
 *
 *     try {
 *       const fresh = await fetchFullPackage(managedId);
 *       if (fresh) setManage(fresh);
 *     } catch {
 *       // keep the current snapshot
 *     }
 *
 * — true of what it did, and the reason it was wrong. The record in `manage`
 * is ALREADY known to be out of date at that point: the action the author just
 * fired is what changed it. So "keep the current snapshot" keeps a snapshot
 * whose staleness is established, says nothing about it, and leaves the author
 * reading `Status: Enabled` on a package they just disabled.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ objectui#7881 did not introduce this — it made it swallow MORE
 *
 * Before objectui#7881 (PR #7906) `fetchFullPackage` never read `res.ok`, so
 * this `catch` could only ever see a `res.json()` rejection — a non-JSON body.
 * Now that the helper refuses a non-2xx, the SAME catch also swallows every
 * 401 / 403 / 503 / 500 the endpoint serves. This is the general shape worth
 * naming: fixing one swallowed-error site makes the next swallowing site
 * downstream of it swallow more. A pre-existing defect made much easier to
 * hit, ⛔ not a regression.
 *
 * ## The failure shapes below are MEASURED on THIS arm
 *
 * The tail reads `fetchFullPackage`, i.e. `GET /api/v1/packages`, served by
 * the direct-mount registrar (`@objectstack/rest` `package-routes.ts`). Its
 * list handler has no hand-written body: the success leaves through `sendOk`
 * and every failure through `sendError` / `sendThrownError`, which write
 * `{ success: false, error: { code, message, ...optional } }`. Reachable
 * without a query string (this call sends none, so the `VALIDATION_ERROR` 400
 * of the sibling `:id` routes is not on this path): `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`
 * (the anonymous floor), `403 FORBIDDEN` (the `studio.access` / `setup.access`
 * capability gate), `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (either half of the two-source
 * merge refusing a read it could not perform) and `500 INTERNAL_ERROR`, whose
 * prose the door withholds in favour of the generic sentence — which is why
 * `error.code` travels with the message.
 *
 * Two shapes exist here that are NOT that envelope, and both are driven below:
 * a non-JSON error body (a proxy's HTML 502/504 — §3) and a `fetch` that
 * rejects outright, with no response at all (offline / DNS / connection reset
 * — §4). And one non-failure that produced the same silence: a SUCCESSFUL read
 * whose list no longer contains the package (§5) — `fresh === null`, which the
 * old `if (fresh)` dropped just as quietly as the catch dropped a throw.
 *
 * ## What the fix does, and why the sheet CLOSES
 *
 * `PackageDetailSheet` is an ACTION surface, and it derives its verb from the
 * record it holds: `enabled = pkg.enabled !== false && pkg.status !==
 * 'disabled'` picks the button's label AND the endpoint it POSTs
 * (`.../${enabled ? 'disable' : 'enable'}`, `PackagesPage.tsx`). Left open on
 * a snapshot known to be pre-action it does not merely show a stale badge — it
 * re-arms the author with the verb they just fired. It is still a DEGRADATION
 * and not a throw (objectui#7368: one 503 must not take the Studio down): the
 * editor, the top bar and the list all stay, and reopening the sheet re-runs
 * the same read one click away.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why there are negative controls
 *
 * §6 must stay GREEN with the fix reverted — that is what proves the pins
 * above are not restating an existing assertion, and it is what a DEGENERATE
 * "just close the sheet" fix cannot pass: closing unconditionally breaks the
 * successful refresh (§6.1/§6.2), and closing without reporting fails every
 * report pin (§1-§5). Both non-fixes are excluded from opposite sides.
