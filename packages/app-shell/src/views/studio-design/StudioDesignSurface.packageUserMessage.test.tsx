/**
 * objectui#7938 — `fetchFullPackage` read `error.message` and `error.code` and
 * stopped, so a producer-marked `error.userMessage` arrived on the wire and had
 * nowhere to appear.
 *
 * ## The field is MEASURED to arrive, not assumed
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/packages` is served by the direct-mount registrar
 * (`@objectstack/rest` `package-routes.ts`), whose `sendThrownError` spreads
 * the marked channel onto the wire beside `details` and `declaredCode`:
 *
 *     const extra = {
 *       ...(thrown.details ? { details: thrown.details } : {}),
 *       ...(declaredCode !== undefined ? { declaredCode } : {}),
 *       ...(thrown.userMessage !== undefined ? { userMessage: thrown.userMessage } : {}),
 *     };
 *
 * and `sendError` (`@objectstack/types` `response-envelope.ts`) nests that
 * whole object under `error`:
 *
 *     res.status(status).json({ success: false, error: { code, message, ...extra } });
 *
 * — which is exactly the `error.userMessage` path these pins drive.
 *
 * ## Why the 5xx band is where it bites
 *
 * The same door withholds the producer's PROSE above:
 *
 *     const message = thrown.status >= 500 && looksLikeInternalErrorLeak(thrown.message)
 *       ? INTERNAL_ERROR_MESSAGE
 *       : thrown.message;
 *
 * The withhold rewrites a LOCAL `message` const and `looksLikeInternalErrorLeak`
 * is only ever handed `thrown.message`, so `thrown.userMessage` is never an
 * input to it — the marked text rides through a sanitised 500 untouched. That
 * door's own note states the rule: "a marked text is the producer's deliberate
 * statement to the caller at any status", and the framework pins the pair in
 * `packages/rest/src/package-door-user-message.test.ts` §4, which asserts
 * `error.message === INTERNAL_ERROR_MESSAGE` and the marked text intact on the
 * same body.
 *
 * So on a marked 500/503 this reader showed the author the GENERIC sentence and
 * silently dropped the SPECIFIC one written for them. Nothing invalid was
 * displayed — the toast was correct, just generic — which is exactly what made
 * the loss quiet.
 *
 * ## Three combinations, because two of the three were never the failing case
 *
 * Both fields are optional and independent, so §1-§3 drive all three reachable
 * combinations rather than only the one that motivated the card:
 *
 *   §1 `message` only        — the overwhelmingly common unmarked refusal.
 *                              Byte-identical output before and after. GREEN
 *                              with the fix reverted, deliberately: this is the
 *                              pin that stops "prefer `userMessage`" from being
 *                              implemented as "read `userMessage` INSTEAD".
 *   §2 `userMessage` only    — the marked text is the only prose on the body.
 *                              Was `HTTP 503`; the author now reads the
 *                              sentence written for them. Its two words-pins go
 *                              RED when reverted; its third case asserts the
 *                              report CHANNEL and stays green either way.
 *   §3 both                  — the live 5xx case. Was the generic sentence;
 *                              now the marked one. RED when reverted.
 *
 * §4 pins how `code` composes across those combinations — it is appended to
 * whichever prose won, and rescues neither the empty case nor a non-string
 * mark. §5 drives the SECOND caller of this shared read (the managed-snapshot
 * refresh, objectui#7907's tail) so the fix is shown reaching both, not one.
 * §6 is the negative control: a successful read is untouched.
