/**
 * objectui#6514 — the record form page gates on the keys `@objectstack/spec`
 * DECLARES, and no longer on the one it refuses.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The page filtered `objectDef.fields` with
 * `evaluateVisibility(f.visible, expressionEvaluator)`. `FieldSchema` is a
 * `strictObject` and `visible` is not one of its keys — it appears in
 * `FIELD_KEY_GUIDANCE` as prose that REFUSES the spelling, deliberately not as
 * an alias, because "this surface declares BOTH forms and the two answers have
 * opposite polarity". So the gate was unreachable through the authoring
 * surface: a field `visible` written in object metadata is rejected before it
 * can reach this call site, and the census re-run for this card found zero
 * field-level `visible` keys across the framework's 113 `*.object.*` files.
 *
 * The declared keys are `hidden` (a static boolean — INVERTED, so
 * `visible: false` is `hidden: true`) and `visibleWhen` (a CEL predicate, shown
 * only when TRUE). Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-27, Option A.
 *
 * ## Why BOTH directions are asserted, per key
 *
 * `visible` -> `hidden` is an INVERSION, and getting an inversion backwards
 * raises no error. It produces one of two silent outcomes: a field that should
 * show disappears with no diagnostic, or a field that should be hidden LEAKS to
 * a user who must not see it. A suite that asserts only the hiding half passes
 * just as well against logic that hides EVERYTHING, so it would prove nothing
 * about the polarity. Each key therefore carries a hiding case and its
 * complement:
 *
 *   - `hidden: true` -> absent          | `hidden: false` / absent -> present
 *   - a FALSE `visibleWhen` -> absent   | a TRUE `visibleWhen` -> present
 *
 * Measured directions (both legs run for this card):
 *   - RED before the fix: every `hidden: true` / false-`visibleWhen` absence
 *     case (the page read neither key, so those fields rendered), and both
 *     dead-key cases (the page hid them on the refused spelling).
 *   - GREEN before the fix: the complements — a field with no `visible` was
 *     already present. They are not red-before-fix and cannot be; they are the
 *     half that goes RED under an INVERTED implementation, which is the actual
 *     threat model. That leg was measured by mutating the helper's polarity;
 *     see the PR body.
 *
 * ## Composition
 *
 * `hidden` and `visibleWhen` compose as AND (a field shows only if it is not
 * statically hidden AND its predicate holds) — the same shape
 * `@object-ui/core`'s `resolveFieldRuleState` already uses for the
 * `readonly`/`readonlyWhen` and `required`/`requiredWhen` pairs, where the
 * static and the predicate OR into the restrictive verdict. `visibleWhen` is
 * documented as "shown only when TRUE (else hidden)" — a necessary condition,
 * never a licence to un-hide a statically hidden field.
 *
 * ## Fenced boundary
 *
 * Field-level visibility keeps the contract's CURRENT scope: no `current_user`
 * binding is added here, and none is needed — `current_user` is already bound
 * on this page's evaluator by objectui#6493, and the spec's fault-open at this
 * tier is documented as intended (objectui#6443 / #6487). Per-user field hiding
 * goes through the option/form layers that bind the user. Nothing in this file
 * changes which roots the evaluator carries.
