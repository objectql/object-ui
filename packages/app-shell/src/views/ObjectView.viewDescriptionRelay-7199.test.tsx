/**
 * objectui#7199 — the object page relays a per-view `description`.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `renderListView` builds `fullSchema` by spreading the OBJECT's `listSchema`
 * and then relaying selected keys off the active `viewDef`. `label`, `sort`,
 * `filter`, `hiddenFields`, `inlineEdit`, `color`, `allowExport` and ~40 more
 * each have a rung. `description` had NONE, so `schema.description` at the
 * `ListView` end could only ever be the object-level list's description, and a
 * per-view one was unreachable — authored, validated, built and served
 * correctly, then dropped here.
 *
 * It is the "declared and inert" shape: nothing errors, every authoring gate
 * passes, the API serves the value, and the only symptom is that the sentence
 * the author wrote for the user is not on the screen. It bites hardest where a
 * view description is most wanted — disclosing a caveat about the view itself.
 *
 * ## The value DOES arrive here — the relay is where it dies
 *
 * Confirmed rather than assumed, because "the API serves it" traces the value
 * only as far as the meta API, not as far as this component's props:
 * `buildViewTabs` composes each entry through `viewEntry`, which is
 * `Object.assign` over the authored body and stamps only `id` afterwards. No
 * key whitelist runs between `objectDef.listViews` and `activeView`, so an
 * authored `description` is present on `viewDef` and this relay is the single
 * point of loss. The `objectDef.description` case below is what proves the fix
 * did not simply reach for the object-level value instead.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ NOT the page header's subtitle
 *
 * This page also renders `subtitle={objectDef.description ? objectDesc(objectDef) : undefined}`
 * on its `PageHeader`. That is the OBJECT's blurb — a different value with a
 * different audience. Crossing the two would put a view's caveat where the
 * object's description belongs, and would make the relay look fixed while
 * showing the wrong sentence. The last case holds them apart.
 *
 * ## Direction and counts, written before the run (reverse verification)
 *
 * Deleting the `description:` rung from `fullSchema` was PREDICTED to turn the
 * four view-authored cases RED (`captured.description` `undefined`, or the
 * object-level value where the view's own was expected) and to leave the two
 * fallback/absence controls GREEN — they resolve through the `...listSchema`
 * spread, which the rung does not touch. Predicted 4 red / 2 passing. Measured
 * outcome is recorded on the PR.
 *
 * ## Why the schema is captured rather than rendered
 *
 * The claim is about what THIS file hands down, so `ListView` is stubbed and
 * its `schema` prop recorded — the same posture as
 * `ObjectView.titleFieldConvergence.test.tsx`. Whether the captured value then
 * reaches the DOM (and how a locale map resolves once it does) is the other
 * half of objectui#7199 and is pinned in `plugin-list` by
 * `ListView.descriptionInlineLocale-7199.test.tsx`.
