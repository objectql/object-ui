/**
 * objectui#4490, the HOST half — the object list page publishes its record-URL
 * builder so the grid's link column can render a real anchor.
 *
 * The seam was the measured question. `RelatedRecordActionsProvider` mounted
 * only on the record DETAIL body (`RelatedRecordActionsBridge`), which is why
 * PR #4489's anchors reached lookup values there and never the list page. Of
 * the two candidate seams — mount the existing provider on the list host, or
 * thread an href callback through the grid's navigation context — the first
 * needs no new package dependency and no new schema key: app-shell and
 * plugin-grid both already depend on `@object-ui/react`, where the context and
 * its `recordHref` (added by #4489) live.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the part that is this file's own: the URL is built
 * ONCE, by the host, from the same expression its "open in new window" action
 * has always used — so the anchor a user middle-clicks and the tab the row's
 * ⌘-click opens address the same record by construction, not by coincidence.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted, then measured. These are pure
 * functions that do not exist on `origin/main`, so reverting the source does
 * not produce a value mismatch: the import fails and the whole file dies before
 * an assertion runs. Stated plainly because it bounds what this file proves —
 * it pins the builder's CONTRACT going forward (scoping, encoding, the `/view/`
 * strip); the case that discriminates old behavior from new is the anchor
 * itself, in `plugin-grid/src/__tests__/ObjectGrid.linkCellAnchor.test.tsx`.
