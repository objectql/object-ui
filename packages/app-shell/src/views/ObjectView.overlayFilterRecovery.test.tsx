/**
 * objectui#4155, the RECOVERY half — a poisoned view overlay must stop
 * overriding the source-declared filter, on READ, without a `sys_metadata`
 * delete and a service restart.
 *
 * Two overlay bodies were destructive, both written by the filter panel:
 *
 *   `filter: [{ field: 'x', operator: 'equals', value: '' }]` — the row
 *      `Add filter` inserts. The live grid never applied it, but merged over
 *      the source view (`{ ...source, ...override }`) it BECAME the view's
 *      whole filter, so the list came back `total: 0` for every user.
 *   `filter: []` — what "Clear all" wrote. Not poisoned, but it still deletes
 *      the source declaration (`status not_in [archived, deleted]`) silently.
 *
 * The merge semantics are MEASURED here, not assumed, because the fix rests on
 * them: `{ ...source, ...override }` is key-wise, so an override carrying
 * `filter: []` is NOT the same as an override carrying no `filter` — the first
 * replaces the declaration with "no filter", the second falls through to it.
 * That is why the sanitizer deletes the key rather than writing an empty array.
 *
 * SUITE DIRECTION — predicted, then MEASURED, and the two did not agree; the
 * measured result is the one recorded here.
 *
 * Predicted: the first two blocks RED against `origin/main` (which returns the
 * override untouched), while the `what must NOT change` block stayed green in
 * both worlds as a control.
 *
 * Measured (revert the three source files, keep these tests): **every** case in
 * this file goes red — 24 red / 13 green across the #4155 suites. The control
 * block goes red too, and NOT for a behavioural reason: `sanitizeViewOverride`
 * does not exist on `origin/main`, so the import on the next line fails and the
 * whole module dies before a single assertion runs.
 *
 * Worth stating plainly, because it bounds what this file can prove: against
 * `origin/main` the control cases are NOT discriminating — a missing export
 * cannot tell "kept the real conditions" apart from "module did not load". They
 * are controls in the FORWARD direction only, pinning what must not change as
 * the sanitizer is edited from here on. The cases that genuinely discriminate
 * old behaviour from new are the ones whose failure message quotes a VALUE
 * (`expected [ { field: 'status', … } ] to deeply equal []`), not an import.
