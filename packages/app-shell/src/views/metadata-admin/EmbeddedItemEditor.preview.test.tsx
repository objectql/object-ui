/**
 * The embedded editor mounts the registered preview (objectui#4132).
 *
 * `ValidationPreview` is a complete renderer — rule label, description, the
 * severity/message callout, per-variant bodies, tags — and until #4132 the only
 * route that mounted it was `ResourceEditPage`'s Preview tab on the STANDALONE
 * `validation` resource, i.e. the door ADR-0088 / objectstack#4509 retired. The
 * governed path (`object.validations`, which is what the framework actually
 * evaluates) goes Related tab → `MetadataDetailDrawer` → `EmbeddedItemEditor`,
 * and that rendered a bare `SchemaForm`. Retiring the door without moving the
 * renderer would have deleted a working surface from the product; moving it is
 * the point of the change (#4132's shape B).
 *
 * SCOPE OF THIS FILE: `EmbeddedItemEditor` is the entirety of the drawer's
 * embedded branch — `MetadataDetailDrawer` renders `<EmbeddedItemEditor …/>`
 * and nothing else for `kind: 'embedded'`. It is mounted directly here rather
 * than through the drawer because the drawer wraps it in a Radix `Sheet`, which
 * does not settle under this project's light DOM setup (measured: the same
 * assertions through `<MetadataDetailDrawer>` never completed, while the editor
 * alone renders in ~6s). The drawer's half — that it forwards `editAs` to this
 * component — is pinned off source text in `anchors.validation-retired.test.ts`,
 * so both halves of the path are asserted, neither by a hanging render.
 *
 * The wiring is deliberately GENERIC — `getMetadataPreview(editAs)` — not a
 * `validation` special case. Today only `validation` has both an `editAs` anchor
 * and a registered preview, so today it is the only sub-type affected; the
 * control below pins that a sub-type WITHOUT a registered preview (`index`)
 * still renders its editor and grows no empty preview chrome.
 *
 * Read points asserted here are exactly the ones objectstack#7427's liveness
 * sweep graded `dead` for being unreachable — `label`, `description`, `tags` —
 * so this file is the evidence those rows can be re-graded.

/**
 * Deliberately WITHOUT a `condition` property. `SchemaForm` routes that name
 * (`CONDITION_FIELD_NAMES`) to the CEL `ConditionWidget`, whose formula loader
 * is a dynamic import — an unbounded module load inside a bounded test window,
 * the trap AGENTS.md §测试纪律 describes (measured here: the file never
 * settles). The rule's `condition` is still asserted below, where it belongs:
 * on the PREVIEW, which reads it straight off the draft.
