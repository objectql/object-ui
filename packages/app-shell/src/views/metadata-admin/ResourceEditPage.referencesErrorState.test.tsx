/**
 * The References panel must tell three facts apart — objectui#5110.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `loadReferences()` held two pieces of state, `refs: MetadataReference[] |
 * null` and `refsLoading: boolean`, and the panel read `refs == null` as
 * "still loading". That left no value to mean "the check failed", so the
 * catch wrote `setRefs([])` — the SAME state a successful scan finding
 * nothing produces — and the panel rendered it as, verbatim:
 *
 *     "Nothing in the metadata graph points at this item. Safe to delete."
 *
 * Every failure took that path: a refused request, a dropped connection, an
 * expired session, an unparseable body, and (after objectstack#9326 / PR
 * #9425 made the wire honest) a truthful `501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED`. The producer
 * fix converted "we cannot answer" from a lying `200 {references: []}` into
 * a correct refusal, and this catch converted it straight back into the lie.
 * The only trace was a `console.error`. The operator is on this panel
 * *because* they are about to delete something.
 *
 * ## What is pinned here
 *
 * One test per arm of the union that replaced the pair, because the defect
 * was precisely that two of the three arms were the same value:
 *
 *   1. loading  — in flight, scanning indicator, no verdict of any kind
 *   2. empty    — a COMPLETED scan that found nothing still says "Safe to
 *                 delete"; the fix must not buy honesty by deleting the one
 *                 case where that sentence is true
 *   3. error    — the failure is shown as a failure, the "Safe to delete"
 *                 sentence is absent from the document, the count badge does
 *                 not render a false `0`, and Retry re-runs the same loader
 *
 * Case 2 is what makes case 3 an assertion rather than a tautology: without
 * it, deleting the empty state entirely would also make "Safe to delete"
 * unreachable and every error assertion would pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 * ## Why the retry pin asserts the SECOND call, not just the button
 *
 * The pre-fix re-entry guard was `if (refs != null || refsLoading) return;`.
 * Under the old shape a failure left `refs = []`, i.e. non-null — so even if
 * the old code had grown a retry button, the loader would have refused to run
 * again and the button would have been decorative. The guard now falls
 * through on `idle` and `error` and holds on `loading` and `loaded`, so the
 * suite asserts both directions: retry after an error DOES re-request, and
 * reopening the sheet after a success does NOT.
