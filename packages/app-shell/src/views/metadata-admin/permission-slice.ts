/**
 * Package-scoped slice merge for the permission matrix (ADR-0086 P0).
 *
 * A Permission Set / Profile is a single metadata record whose `objects` and
 * `fields` maps accumulate authorization rows contributed by many packages.
 * When the Access matrix is opened inside a package context it must:
 *
 *   1. show only the objects that package declares (scope), and
 *   2. on Save write back ONLY that slice — leaving every row contributed by
 *      other packages byte-for-byte intact.
 *
 * Overwriting the whole record (the pre-P0 behavior) silently drops the rows
 * other packages contributed. {@link mergePermissionSlice} rebuilds the record
 * from a freshly-read base, keeping every out-of-scope row, and overlaying the
 * in-scope rows plus every facet the editor can author
 * ({@link EDITOR_AUTHORED_KEYS}).

 * author ({@link EDITOR_AUTHORED_KEYS}) comes from `edited`; `base` supplies

 * else: the load path narrows exactly those two maps and hands every other
 * facet to the editors unscoped, so a facet held back here protected no one and
 * only discarded the author's work.
 *
 * A key ABSENT from `edited` still comes from `base`. Absence means "this
 * caller does not model the facet", not "the author cleared it" — the facet
 * editors always write a value (an emptied policy list is `[]`, present), so
 * clearing still persists as clearing.
