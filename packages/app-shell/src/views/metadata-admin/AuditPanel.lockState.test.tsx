/**
 * The Audit tab's lock column speaks the UI language (objectui#5004).
 *
 * `AuditPanel` renders `MetadataAuditEntry.lockState` through
 * `translateConsoleValue('lock', …)`, and `CONSOLE_VALUE_ZH.lock` used to hold
 * `draft` / `locked` / `published` / `none` — a draft-status vocabulary, not the
 * ADR-0010 §3.6 four-state lock. Alignment was total, not partial:
 *
 *   - `draft` / `locked` / `published` matched NO value `lockState` can hold;
 *   - `none`, the one entry that did match, is excluded by the call site's own
 *     guard (an unlocked row renders an em dash), so it was unreachable;
 *   - the three values that DO reach the helper — `no-overlay` / `no-delete` /
 *     `full` — had no entry, so zh-CN fell through to the raw token.
 *
 * Hit rate 0/3: a zh-CN admin opening any locked item's Audit panel read bare
 * English in a column headed 锁状态.
 *
 * The state list below is bound to `MetadataAuditEntry['lockState']` itself
 * rather than spelled freely, so a fifth lock state is covered by these cases
 * the moment the union gains it. Unlike objectui#4982's overlay scopes there is
 * no `@objectstack/spec` enum to read at runtime — this union is hand-written in
 * `packages/data-objectstack` — hence the `satisfies`-checked key trick instead
 * of a `.options` array. (The compile-time half of the coverage is
 * `LOCK_STATE_ZH` in `./i18n`, whose key type is that union: a new state with no
 * zh-CN label fails `type-check` before it can reach the column.)
