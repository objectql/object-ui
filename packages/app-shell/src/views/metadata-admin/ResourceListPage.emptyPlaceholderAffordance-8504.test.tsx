/**
 * The metadata list's default cell draws the shared `EmptyValue`
 * (objectui#8504).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `defaultCell` — the renderer every column without its own `render` falls back
 * to — spelled `<span className="text-muted-foreground">—</span>` for a null or
 * empty value: no `data-slot`, no `aria-label`, and none of the shared
 * component's `select-none` / `no-underline` / `pointer-events-none`. A screen
 * reader crossing an empty Description cell heard a naked punctuation mark.
 *
 * The `pointer-events-none` half is not cosmetic here. `defaultCell`'s output
 * for column 0 is rendered INSIDE the row's `<Link>`, so a hand-rolled span
 * inherited the link colour and stayed selectable — a missing value that looked
 * clickable, the same affordance bug PR #8503 named in the grid's link cells.
 *
 * ## Which case DISCRIMINATES — MEASURED, not predicted
 *
 * The caricature was RUN: `defaultCell` rewritten to `return <EmptyValue />`
 * for every value, filled cells included.
 *
 *   - `NON-REGRESSION` refuses it, on "the value reaches the cell" — under the
 *     caricature the Description column stops printing descriptions.
 *   - `THE DEFECT` fails ONLY on its control. Its headline claim is equally
 *     true of a table that has stopped printing values.
 *   - The third case SURVIVES the caricature entirely, which is why it is
 *     labelled a scope declaration rather than quoted as proof.
 *
 * A first run of the caricature failed all three on the HARNESS instead — the
 * row lookup read column 0, which `defaultCell` also renders, so the name the
 * row was found by disappeared. The lookup now reads the row link's `href`.
 *
 * Reverting the fix turns `THE DEFECT` red on "the empty cell draws the shared
 * placeholder" and leaves `NON-REGRESSION` green.
 *
 * ## The visual delta
 *
 * `text-muted-foreground` (full opacity) becomes the shared
 * `text-muted-foreground/50`: one deliberate step more muted, plus the three
 * affordances and the accessible name. The glyph is unchanged.
 *
 * ## Harness notes
 *
 * The type is a name no `registry.ts` entry claims, so `resolveResourceConfig`
 * returns the bare default — no `ListPage`, no `listColumns`, no `listFilter` —
 * which is exactly the path `defaultCell` serves. `useMetadataLocale` is pinned
 * to `en-US` so the column lookup does not depend on the host's
 * `navigator.language`.
 *
 * Assertions are scoped to ONE cell of ONE row (objectui#8495: a table-wide
 * "no placeholder anywhere" assertion would fail against the correct
 * implementation the moment any other column is legitimately empty).
