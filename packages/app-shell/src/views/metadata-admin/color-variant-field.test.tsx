/**
 * The designer's swatch palette ↔ the spec's `colorVariant` enum (objectui#3359).
 *
 * `COLOR_VARIANTS`' header calls itself "Canonical semantic palette (mirrors the
 * renderer's colorVariant tokens)" — a claim that was, until #3359, unverifiable
 * on the renderer side: `DatasetWidget` read `colorVariant` nowhere, so the
 * dataset-bound metric card had no tokens to mirror. Wiring the renderer up
 * closed that gap and opened a sharper one: three lists now state the same
 * vocabulary — this picker, the spec enum (`WidgetColorVariantSchema`), and
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/colorVariants.ts` — and a silent disagreement between
 * them would trade a declared-but-unenforced key for a declared-two-ways key,
 * which is harder to find because every surface looks correct on its own.
 *
 * So the canonical row is pinned here against the spec itself, in the SAME order
 * (the picker renders it as a swatch row; the order is what the admin sees).
 * The renderer's own table is pinned to the same enum in
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/__tests__/DatasetWidget.colorVariant.test.tsx`; between
 * the two, all three lists are held to one source.
