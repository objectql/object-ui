/**
 * Pins that the Access matrix never AUTHORS the retired lifecycle bits
 * `allowRestore` / `allowPurge` (objectui#6595).
 *
 * Both keys gated `restore` / `purge` ObjectQL operations that have never
 * existed — a dispatched restore/purge is denied unconditionally by the
 * evaluator's fail-closed destructive-operation backstop — so every tick of
 * the `Re` / `Pu` checkboxes was a grant no runtime has ever read.
 * `@objectstack/spec` retired both as `retiredKey()` tombstones
 * (objectstack#12497; maintainer ruling 2026-08-26 accepting objectstack#1883
 * recommendation B, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove). They return with the M2
 * lifecycle initiative, whose restart is recorded on objectstack#1883.
 *
 * Two directions are pinned, because a missing column is only half of it:
 *  - the COLUMN SET, not merely the absence of two keys. A set assertion is
 *    what stops a retired key drifting back in beside a live one, and it is
 *    the direction that also proves `allowTransfer` — enforced upstream, and
 *    explicitly out of this removal — is still authorable.
 *  - what reaches the WIRE. "Grant all" seeds a row from the column list, so
 *    the key set it writes is the real product of this change; asserting on
 *    the saved payload catches a column list that drifts back into the seed
 *    without a header cell to show for it.
 *
 * ## The one assertion the spec bump is expected to revisit
 *
 * `carries a stored legacy value through untouched` pins TODAY's posture: the
 * installed `@objectstack/spec` (17.2.0, measured 2026-08-27) still ACCEPTS
 * both keys at permission parse, so stripping a stored value here would delete
 * data the schema still honours. Once the bump carrying the retirement lands,
 * a carried-through value becomes a body the schema REFUSES, and strip-on-load
 * becomes correct (objectui#4644's resolution for `indexed`). That is the bump
 * PR's change to make, deliberately, replacing this assertion — not a red to
 * be quietly deleted.
