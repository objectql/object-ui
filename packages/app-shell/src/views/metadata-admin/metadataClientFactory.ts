/**
 * The single construction point for {@link MetadataClient} in the console.
 *
 * Authentication is a cross-cutting concern, but `MetadataClient` is a
 * framework-agnostic HTTP client that defaults its `fetch` to the bare
 * `globalThis.fetch` (no `Authorization` header). The console authenticates
 * to `/api/v1/*` with a **Bearer token** kept in `localStorage`
 * (`auth-session-token`) — there is no session cookie — so any client built on
 * the raw global fetch is *unauthenticated* and every `/api/v1/meta/*` request
 * comes back `401 unauthenticated`. That failure only surfaces in the
 * token-based console (a same-origin cookie deployment masks it), which is why
 * two construction sites silently regressed.
 *
 * Funnelling every console client through this factory bakes in the shared
 * authenticated fetch (Bearer token + `X-Tenant-ID` + `Accept-Language`, via
 * {@link createAuthenticatedFetch}) so a caller can no longer *forget* to
 * authenticate. `metadata-client-auth.ratchet.test.ts` forbids a bare
 * `new MetadataClient(` anywhere else in app-shell so this stays the one source
 * of truth. This is additive for cookie deployments — `createAuthenticatedFetch`
 * never touches `credentials`, so a same-origin session cookie still flows.
 */

/**
 * One authenticated fetch shared by every console metadata client.
 * `createAuthenticatedFetch()` returns a stateless wrapper — it reads the
 * Bearer token and active organization from storage *lazily on each call* — so
 * a single shared instance is both correct (always current) and cheaper than
 * re-allocating the closure per client.
