/**
 * The lock banner must never render a headline-less amber box — objectui#5024.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The banner's title was three independent `&&` branches with no `else` and no
 * fallback:
 *
 *   {layered?.lock === 'full' && t('engine.edit.lockFull', locale)}
 *   {layered?.lock === 'no-overlay' && t('engine.edit.lockNoOverlay', locale)}
 *   {layered?.lock === 'no-delete' && t('engine.edit.lockNoDelete', locale)}
 *
 * while the switch that OPENS the banner is `layered?.lock && lock !== 'none'`
 * — true for *any* non-`none` value. So a lock state outside the ADR-0010 §3.6
 * four opens the amber box, draws the padlock and the border, and leaves the
 * title `<div>` empty: a locked-looking banner that never says what is locked
 * or why.
 *
 * ## Why this is reachable today, not only "the day a fifth state lands"
 *
 * The card framed it as dormant, on the reading that both hand-written unions
 * list the same four values. The unions are not the gate. `MetadataClient.
 * layered()` passes the wire value through with an unchecked cast —
 *
 *   ...(body.lock !== undefined ? { lock: body.lock as MetadataLayered['lock'] } : {}),
 *
 * — over a `res.json()` body. There is no Zod parse, no allowlist, no default
 * on this path. The union constrains what this repo may *write*; it constrains
 * nothing about what a server may *send*. A backend that grows a fifth state
 * reaches this banner with zero code change here, which is why the fix has to
 * be a runtime fallback and not only a compile-time exhaustiveness check: a
 * `satisfies` assertion is satisfied by the current four either way and would
 * have left the blank banner exactly as it was.
 *
 * ## What this suite pins
 *
 * The four known states keep their existing sentences (this half passes before
 * the fix — it is the control that says a red fifth-value case is the defect
 * and not a broken harness), and an out-of-vocabulary state renders a loud,
 * non-empty fallback that also surfaces the raw token so the state a server
 * actually sent is diagnosable from the screen.
