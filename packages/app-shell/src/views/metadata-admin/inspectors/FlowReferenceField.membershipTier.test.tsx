/**
 * objectui#5309 — the approver membership-tier select must offer the tiers the
 * SERVER accepts, never a list hand-spelled in this package.
 *
 * The picker used to carry a literal `owner` / `admin` / `member` array under a
 * comment attributing the set to better-auth. ADR-0105 D8 added
 * `delegated_admin` to `sys_member.role`, and the copy went stale in the two
 * ways a stale vocabulary always goes wrong:
 *
 *   1. the tier could not be PICKED — the control offered a quarter less than
 *      the column stores and the schema publishes;
 *   2. a stored `{ type: 'org_membership_level', value: 'delegated_admin' }`
 *      row rendered as `delegated_admin (invalid)` — a spec-valid,
 *      runtime-resolvable approver labelled invalid to the author's face.
 *
 * Load-bearing behaviours, in the order the fix establishes them:
 *
 *   1. a SERVER-published enum (`xRef.sources[...]`, carried through by
 *      `json-schema-to-fields`) wins over the local fallback — the same
 *      precedence rule this file already applies to record lookups, and the
 *      only one that cannot drift from what the engine accepts;
 *   2. the published vocabulary is used VERBATIM — order included — so the
 *      picker cannot quietly re-impose a local ordering;
 *   3. a tier the local pin has never heard of still renders as a real,
 *      humanized choice rather than a raw token;
 *   4. with NO published source (a server predating the annotation) the
 *      fallback is DERIVED from the spec's own published option list, so it is
 *      not a second source of truth and cannot go stale the way the literal
 *      did;
 *   5. an empty / non-enum source falls back rather than rendering an EMPTY
 *      strict select — a select with nothing in it traps the author, the one
 *      thing this control must never do;
 *   6. the reported symptom: a stored `delegated_admin` stops rendering
 *      "(invalid)" — while a genuinely out-of-vocabulary value still does.
 *
 * ## Pin state at the time of writing (deliberate, read before editing)
 *
 * This repo pins `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0`, which does NOT yet carry
 * objectstack#9942 (`ORG_MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS` derived from
 * `BUILTIN_MEMBERSHIP_ROLES`): its `APPROVER_VALUE_SOURCES.org_membership_level`
 * projection still publishes three values. Nothing here asserts that
 * projection — it would be red for reasons unrelated to this behaviour.
 *
 * What this pin DOES carry is `BUILTIN_MEMBERSHIP_ROLE_OPTIONS`, already the
 * whole four-value vocabulary with labels, which the spec documents as "the
 * picker's vocabulary". That is what the fallback derives from, so every
 * assertion below holds under the current pin AND after the bump.
