/**
 * **The directory-lookup table is derived from the spec, not restated** (objectui#3017).
 *
 * `KIND_TO_RECORD_LOOKUP` used to hard-code `object` / `valueField` for the four
 * directory-backed kinds under a comment saying it mirrored the spec's
 * `APPROVER_VALUE_BINDINGS`. It now composes objectui's presentation on top of
 * the published `APPROVER_VALUE_SOURCES`, so those two fields cannot drift by
 * construction.
 *
 * What is still worth asserting is that the composition stays WIRED. Two ways it
 * could quietly stop being: the derivation could yield an empty table (every
 * kind skipped because the spec changed shape), or a kind could lose its
 * `data` source and vanish from the picker. Both would degrade a resolvable
 * reference back to a free-text box — exactly the framework #3508 failure that
 * publishing the binding existed to end, and exactly the kind of regression a
 * comment cannot catch.
