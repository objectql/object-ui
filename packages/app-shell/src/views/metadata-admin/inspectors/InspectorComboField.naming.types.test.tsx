/**
 * `InspectorComboField`'s naming contract is enforced by the TYPE, so it is
 * pinned at compile time (objectui#3997).
 *
 * The atom accepts exactly one of `label` / `ariaLabel` / `id` — never zero,
 * never two. Zero is an anonymous `button[role=combobox]`: assistive tech reads
 * "combobox" with no idea which field it edits. Two is the double-announcement
 * failure objectui#3961/#3978 exists to avoid. Both were authorable before this
 * change, and five of the eleven live call sites had in fact authored zero.
 *
 * The reason this is a TYPE and not a runtime guard is that neither mistake has
 * a runtime symptom the component could detect and report: an unnamed combobox
 * renders, lays out and commits values perfectly. It is only wrong for the users
 * who cannot see it. So the check has to happen at authoring time or not at all.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists separately, and why it is listed
 *
 * The assertions below are its entire point, so it is listed in
 * `packages/app-shell/tsconfig.typetests.json`. That listing is the difference
 * between a pin and a decoration: the package's build tsconfig excludes
 * `**\/*.test.tsx`, and vitest erases types before running, so a
 * `@ts-expect-error` written in an ordinary `*.test.tsx` file in this directory
 * is read by NO compiler — it neither fails when the error disappears nor when
 * the error was never there. This was drafted that way first, and the mutation
 * run said so: making naming optional again produced a completely green
 * `tsc --noEmit`. That is objectui#3009's failure verbatim (assertions that
 * never ran, under a header calling them the real enforcement), and
 * `tsconfig.typetests.json`'s own header warns about it — so the type-level
 * cases moved here, out of `_shared.labels.test.tsx`, where they are compiled.
 *
 * The runtime `expect` at the bottom is deliberately thin: the DOM consequences
 * (which element carries the id, what the accessible name resolves to, that the
 * id never lands on the Radix `Popover` root) are pinned in
 * `_shared.labels.test.tsx`, which renders. This file only has to be a file
 * vitest can run without complaining that it holds no tests.
