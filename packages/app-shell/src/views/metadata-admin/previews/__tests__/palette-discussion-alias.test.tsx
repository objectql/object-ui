/**
 * objectui#5495 — the page palette advertises the CANONICAL `record:discussion`,
 * and the legacy `record:chatter` stays RENDERABLE while no longer advertised.
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why it is a separate file
 *
 * `block-config.test.ts` derives palette coverage from `PageComponentType`, so
 * it already fails when a spec block type has no decision at all. What it
 * cannot see is WHICH of two interchangeable spellings the decision picked:
 * offering `record:chatter` and excluding `record:discussion` satisfies every
 * derived assertion in that file exactly as well as the reverse. The direction
 * was a maintainer ruling (2026-08-22, Option A — the palette offers the
 * canonical name), and a ruling that nothing asserts is a comment.
 *
 * ## The second half is the one that matters
 *
 * "Excluded from the palette" and "removed" are one careless edit apart, and
 * the careless edit is invisible: `record:chatter` no longer appears in
 * `BLOCK_TYPE_META`, so a later reader who deletes its registration in
 * `plugin-detail/src/index.tsx` breaks every page schema in the wild that spells
 * the block the Salesforce way — and nothing in the palette suite objects,
 * because the palette is exactly where the type is supposed to be absent now.
 *
 * So the renderability half is asserted here, next to the exclusion that could
 * be mistaken for a retirement:
 *
 *   - the registry still resolves the alias, to the SAME renderer function the
 *     canonical name resolves to (identity, not "both are defined" — two
 *     independent renderers that happened to diverge would pass the latter);
 *   - and the alias schema still renders the discussion panel, asserted on the
 *     DOM rather than on the registration, because a registration pointing at a
 *     renderer that throws is still a registration.
 *
 * Each negative pin carries its positive half, for the reason `block-config.
 * test.ts` states throughout: `expect(BLOCK_TYPE_META['record:chatter'])
 * .toBeUndefined()` passes just as happily over a palette that lost every entry.
