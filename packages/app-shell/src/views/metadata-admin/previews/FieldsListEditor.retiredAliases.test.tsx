/**
 * What the column manager SHOWS and RESERVES after the identity read is
 * retired to the canonical spelling (objectui#5725).
 *
 * The unit pins live in `view-column-io.retiredAliases.test.ts`; this suite
 * mounts the real `FieldsListEditor` because two of the claims are only true
 * end-to-end:
 *
 *   - the positional fallback `col N` actually produces a row the author can
 *     CLICK. That was the open question objectui#5725 declined to take — an
 *     empty field-key box invites re-authoring, an empty list row would leave
 *     nothing to click — and it is answered here by measurement rather than by
 *     reading the fallback and assuming a row comes out of it.
 *   - `usedFieldNames()` reaches the Add-field picker. Measured through the
 *     real popover, so the reachability claim is not taken on trust.
 *
 * NOTE on the size of defect 2: the picker does NOT hide a used field, it tags
 * it "Added" and still lets the author click it. So a spec-refused column
 * mislabelled a field as taken; it never blocked adding it. Recorded here so
 * the pin says what the mechanism does, not what it was assumed to do.
