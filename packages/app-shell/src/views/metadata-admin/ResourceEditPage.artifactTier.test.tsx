/**
 * The metadata-admin designer must claim "provided by an installed package"
 * only for items that really come from one — objectui#4308.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Three surfaces disagreed about one object. For an object published into a
 * WRITABLE package, this page showed the artifact lock banner while Studio
 * presented the same object as editable and the server accepted the PUT. The
 * banner therefore asserted a lock nothing enforced, sending an operator off
 * to "edit it in its source package and republish" for a change they could
 * have made in front of them.
 *
 * The cause was the tier test this page used to decide which of the two-tier
 * gates applies. It asked only "is there a `code` layer, and is it not the
 * `sys_metadata` sentinel" — and an org-authored item satisfies both, because
 * boot-time rehydration of `sys_metadata` re-registers each row under its REAL
 * package id. The framework had already been bitten by the identical read
 * (cloud#970: an app the user had just built went un-editable at the first
 * kernel rebuild) and fixed it by asking ADR-0010 provenance instead. This
 * page still carried the pre-cloud#970 spelling.
 *
 * ## What this suite pins — both directions, deliberately
 *
 * The fix must not degenerate into "drop the lock". Half of these cases assert
 * the banner is GONE where the package is writable, and half assert it is
 * STILL THERE for a genuine code package — which is the objectui#4036 ruling
 * ("a code-defined package is read-only; customize in a writable package") and
 * must survive this change untouched. The unstamped-provenance case pins the
 * fail direction for an older server: no opinion keeps the conservative
 * artifact reading rather than unlocking on a guess.
 *
 * `object` is the type under test because it is the type the card reports and
 * the one where the two tiers actually diverge: `allowOrgOverride: false` (the
 * server refuses overlays of packaged objects with `NOT_OVERRIDABLE`) with
 * `allowRuntimeCreate: true` (orgs author their own). A type with both flags
 * true would be writable under either tier and could not detect the bug.
