 * objectui#4250 — the CROSS-SURFACE control. Four sets across three packages
 * decide how a long-form field is placed, each matched against the RAW type,
 * and each spelled the rich-text type in a way `@objectstack/spec` rejects
 * (`rich_text` / `rich-text` — typo keys in the spec's own `suggestFieldType`
 * table, never a producer's output). The card's warning was that fixing only
 * some of them is WORSE than the uniform gap, because then the detail page and
 * the form disagree about the same field.
 *
 * So this file asks all three placement rules about ONE shared fixture field,
 * from the package that depends on every one of them.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TREATING A GREEN RUN AS PROOF OF THE FIX: the parity
 * assertions here were green BEFORE the fix too — the four sets were uniformly
 * wrong, which is agreement of a kind. Their job is to go red on a HALF fix,
 * and that is how they were verified (reverting one set alone turns
 * `agree on EVERY spec field type` red). The red-before-green-after pins for
 * the fix itself live in each package: `autoLayout.wideSpelling.test.ts` in
 * plugin-detail / plugin-form, and `RelatedList.longFormColumns.test.tsx` for
 * the rendered column set.
