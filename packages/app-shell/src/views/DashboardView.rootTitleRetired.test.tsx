/**
 * Retirement pin — the dashboard-ROOT `title` read arm (objectui#7509).
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-09-04 (decision batch #29, option C): the five root
 * `title` read arms retire together under ADR-0049, and `label` — REQUIRED on
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `DashboardSchema` — becomes the only header source,
 * then the raw `name`. This file pins THIS view's arm; the four siblings carry
 * their own, in the same shape.
 *
 * Shaped like the #5830 / #5852 retirements: the assertion is what a document
 * carrying the retired key RENDERS, not that the code still compiles. A
 * compile-only pin would have passed with the arm still in place.
 *
 * Why the retired key can still arrive at all: the spec refuses root `title` BY
 * NAME (`unrecognized_keys(title)` at the document root), so the save route
 * answers `422 INVALID_METADATA` and no AUTHORED document can acquire it. What
 * retired is compatibility with documents STORED before the refusal existed —
 * a renderer cannot refuse to receive stored metadata, so it is pinned rather
 * than assumed away.
 *
 * ⛔ Widget-level `widget.title` is a DIFFERENT, DECLARED key
 * (`DashboardWidget.title`, the spec's `I18nLabel`) and is NOT retired. The
 * last case is the negative control for exactly that: root and widget arms are
 * told apart by RECEIVER, never by grep, and a sweep that confused them would
 * delete live contract-declared behaviour.
