/**
 * `app-shell` mounts TWO action runtimes into ONE `ActionParamDialog` — pin
 * that they reset it the same way on CLOSE (objectui#6431).
 *
 * - `hooks/useConsoleActionRuntime.tsx` builds a `paramCollectionHandler` and
 *   renders `<ActionParamDialog>` from its own `dialogs` element.
 * - `views/RecordDetailView.tsx` does NOT consume that hook. It builds a
 *   second, near-identical handler and renders its own `<ActionParamDialog>`.
 *
 * They agreed on open and disagreed on close: the hook wrote
 * `setParamState({ open: false, params: [] })` — replacing the whole object,
 * emptying `params` and dropping `title` / `description` / `resolve` — while
 * the view wrote `setParamState(s => ({ ...s, open: false }))`. Same family as
 * objectui#6034 (the confirm pair, pinned in the sibling
 * `RecordDetailView.confirmRuntimeParity-5835.test.tsx`), objectui#5610 and
 * objectui#3320: this view re-implementing a shared runtime and then drifting
 * from it with nothing red in between.
 *
 * ## Which shape won, and why it was re-measured rather than inherited
 *
 * #6034's ruling transfers in FORM but not automatically in SUBSTANCE.
 * `ConfirmDialogState` is display-ish text; `ParamDialogState` carries a form's
 * `params`, so "blank it on close" could plausibly have been the deliberate
 * choice here — dropping a stale form rather than re-rendering it for 200ms.
 * Deciding that needed two readings, and the first `describe` below IS the
 * first of them, kept as an executable measurement rather than a note:
 *
 *  1. **What the dialog renders off `state` after `open` flips false.** Radix
 *     keeps the content mounted through the exit animation, and under the
 *     blanking shape the dialog re-titles itself to the generic
 *     `actionDialog.title`, swaps the action's description for the generic one,
 *     and drops every param row — a form the user just filled in empties out
 *     and re-labels itself while it fades. Under the preserving shape it fades
 *     out intact. Strictly more visible damage than the confirm case, which
 *     only blanked one line of text.
 *
 *  2. **Whether anything depends on `params` NOT surviving the close.** Nothing
 *     does, and in particular the user's typed values are not in `paramState`
 *     at all: they live in `ActionParamDialog`'s own `values` state, which its
 *     `useEffect` reseeds from the param defaults on every `state.open`
 *     false→true edge. A reopen therefore starts blank under BOTH shapes —
 *     pinned by `reopens blank under either reset shape` below, which is the
 *     reading that rules out a product-semantics fork ("should reopening retain
 *     what I typed?"). Nothing a user can observe beyond the fade-out frame
 *     differs between the two shapes, so this stayed a convergence and did not
 *     become a decision card.
 *
 * So: field-preserving wins on this dialog too, on this dialog's own evidence.
 *
 * ## Why the first `describe` asserts on the DOM, not on the state object
 *
 * "The runtime writes the right object" is one inference away from the claim
 * that matters, which is about pixels during a 200ms window. The sibling #6034
 * file asserts at the state object and is right to — it pins a contract between
 * two runtimes. This file additionally drives the REAL `ActionParamDialog`
 * through the REAL Radix presence machinery, so the thing being asserted is the
 * rendered output the user actually sees while the dialog fades.
 *
 * jsdom has no CSS engine, so `getComputedStyle(node).animationName` is always
 * `'none'` and Radix's `Presence` unmounts the content synchronously — the exit
 * window does not exist unless it is modelled. `animationName` is therefore
 * stubbed to be derived from the node's own live `data-state`, which is exactly
 * what the two real classes do (`data-[state=open]:animate-in` /
 * `data-[state=closed]:animate-out`). That model is what `Presence` needs: it
 * compares the animation name captured at mount against the one read at close,
 * and suspends the unmount only when they DIFFER — which is also why a constant
 * stub does not work, and why `data-state` is the only faithful source. The
 * model's premise (those classes exist, with a real duration) is not assumed:
 * `the exit-animation window is real in production` reads them off the shipped
 * `DialogContent`.
