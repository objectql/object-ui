 * RecordApprovalsPanel — the flow step strip is a VERTICAL stepper
 * (objectui#5554).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The strip was a single non-wrapping flex ROW whose steps were each
 * `shrink-0` and whose labels were `whitespace-nowrap`. Its min-content width
 * is therefore the SUM of every step, so intrinsic width grows without bound
 * with step count and label length. On a live 17.1.0 project a real 6-step
 * flow measured 1070px inside a 527px container. The console drawer's twin
 * had no scroller of its own and dragged the whole drawer sideways; THIS one
 * carried `overflow-x-auto`, so it scrolled itself — better, but the tail
 * steps still sat behind a scroll gesture with no visible affordance, and the
 * customer acceptance tester read the clipped strip as "there is no data".
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why not "it renders"
 *
 * "The stepper renders" is green against the broken code too — every step was
 * always in the DOM; the clipping was layout. So the assertions below name the
 * defect's own property: **no element in the stepper may pin intrinsic width,
 * and no element may be a horizontal scroller** — i.e. every step is reachable
 * without dragging anything sideways. Concretely: the container stacks
 * (`flex-col`), each step owns a row, no row is `shrink-0`, every label is
 * `min-w-0` (a flex item defaults to `min-width:auto` = min-content, which is
 * exactly how a long label pushes a row past its container) and none is
 * `whitespace-nowrap`, and nothing in the subtree is an `overflow-x` scroller.
 *
 * ## Viewport and step-count coverage
 *
 * There is no CSSOM in this environment, so these read the class contract
 * Tailwind compiles rather than measured boxes. Every token asserted is named
 * for the exact CSS property whose value caused the reported overflow.
 *
 * Rather than sample two viewports, the suite pins the stronger fact that
 * makes sampling unnecessary: the stepper carries **no breakpoint-prefixed
 * axis, overflow or width-pinning class and no measurement**, so it has the
 * same layout at every viewport — there is no width at which an untested
 * branch takes over. The same argument is made for flow length by rendering
 * 2, 5, 6 and 12 steps and pinning that the layout classes are byte-identical
 * across all four: the reported failure regime (6 steps, the reporter's own
 * CJK labels, verbatim) is exercised directly, and the invariance test rules
 * out a count threshold that could put some other length back on the old path.
 *
 * No build artifact sits between the edit and this test — the root Vitest
 * config aliases every `@object-ui` specifier at that package's source.
