/**
 * objectui#5042, the interface-page seam.
 *
 * `ListView` learned to read the spec's view-level `map` block
 * (`ListMapConfigSchema`), but an ADR-0047 interface page builds the list-view
 * schema itself, and its map binding was assembled from `options.map` alone:
 *
 *     const mapCfg = (view.options as any)?.map ?? (allowedSet.has('map') ? … )
 *
 * So a referenced view declaring the typed block had it dropped one seam ABOVE
 * `ListView`, and the auto-derivation silently stood in for it — the same
 * declared-but-inert shape the card is about, on the path the showcase map page
 * actually renders through.
 *
 * The block is forwarded as `map` rather than folded into `mapCfg` with `??`
 * like the sibling bindings, and the third case here is why: `??` would let a
 * PARTIAL authored block replace the derivation wholesale, so
 * `map: { titleField: 'title' }` alone would drop the auto-derived
 * `locationField` and the page would render no markers at all. Forwarding both
 * lets `ListView` merge them per key, which is the precedence the card settled.

/**
 * objectui#6343 — the derived marker-title binding is GONE, and the object's
 * own declaration keeps its authority.
 *
 * ## Why the binding was removed rather than re-narrated
 *
 * It was added (objectui#5909) to route around a forge that no longer exists:
 * `getMapConfig` used to fill an absent `titleField` with the literal `'name'`
 * and the marker title was a plain `record[titleField]` read, so an object
 * whose display field was not `name` titled every popup `undefined`.
 * objectui#5953 deleted that forge — `ObjectMap` now resolves marker titles
 * through `@object-ui/core#getRecordDisplayName`, exactly like `ObjectKanban`,
 * `ObjectCalendar` and `ObjectGantt` do, and exactly like no sibling deriver
 * binds a title.
 *
 * What was left behind was not a redundancy but an INVERSION. The binding
 * arrives at the resolver as `options.titleField`, which is precedence **step
 * 0** — ahead of the declared `nameField` pointer and its `displayNameField`
 * alias at step 1/2, ahead of the legacy `titleFormat` template at step 3, and
 * ahead of the type-aware derivation from `objectDef.fields` at step 4.
 * Measured against the resolver's ladder, a field name this page picked can
 * only ever change the answer by OUT-RANKING something the object itself
 * declared; in every other case it reproduces, at step 0, the string the
 * resolver already computes at step 1/2/4. That is the whole of its effect,
 * which is why it goes rather than gets described.
 *
 * The ladder carries NO object-level `titleField` rung — the middle term this
 * passage used to name. It was never a step of its own: it was a second `??`
 * leg inside step 0, deleted in objectui#6531 because `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * object schema is a `strictObject` that REJECTS the key with
 * `unrecognized_keys` — the same issue code a nonsense key gets — so no
 * spec-compliant object could ever supply it. See the `getRecordDisplayName`
 * docblock in `@object-ui/core`'s `record-title.ts` for the ladder in full.
 *
 * These arms pin both halves: the product no longer carries a title binding
 * (shape), and the declared side therefore decides at the read site
 * (semantics). The arms that used to pin the derivation are retired with it.
