/**
 * The `@object-ui/types` <-> `@object-ui/plugin-chatbot` chat-message seam
 * (objectui#4399).
 *
 * Two `ChatMessage` types meet in `renderer.tsx`, both on purpose:
 *
 *   - `@object-ui/types`' `ChatMessage` is the **authoring** contract — the
 *     JSON an SDUI schema declares (`ChatMessageSchema` in
 *     `packages/types/src/zod/complex.zod.ts`), so it is deliberately wider:
 *     a `'tool'` role and a `Date` timestamp are authorable.
 *   - `./ChatbotEnhanced`'s `ChatMessage` is the **runtime** contract — what
 *     the React components actually render, so it is deliberately narrower
 *     (three roles, string timestamps) and carries render-only keys the
 *     authoring surface has no business declaring (`buildProgress`, `charts`).
 *
 * Until this module they met as three `messages as any` casts, which erased
 * ALL of the drift rather than the parts that are intentional: a new authored
 * role or a newly required runtime key would have kept compiling and surfaced
 * as rendering behaviour instead of a type error. This module is that seam,
 * written down — one conversion, each narrowing decision named and tested.
 *
 * ## Narrowing decisions
 *
 * | key                    | authoring                                | runtime                     | decision |
 * |------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
 * | `role`                 | `'user'\|'assistant'\|'system'\|'tool'`  | `'user'\|'assistant'\|'system'` | `'tool'` renders as an **assistant** bubble — see {@link toRuntimeRole} |
 * | `timestamp`            | `string \| Date`                         | `string`                    | `Date` -> ISO 8601 — see {@link toRuntimeTimestamp} |
 * | `toolInvocations[].state` | v6 states **+ legacy** `'partial-call'\|'call'\|'result'` | v6 states only | legacy -> v6, per the authoring type's own doc comment — see {@link toRuntimeToolState} |
 * | `metadata`             | `any`                                    | *not declared*              | passed through untouched (see "Pass-through" below) |
 * | everything else        | same shape on both sides                 | —                           | passed through untouched |
 *
 * ## Pass-through — why this is a conversion and not a reconstruction
 *
 * The adapter narrows the drifting fields **by name** and spreads the rest. It
 * deliberately does NOT rebuild the message field-by-field from the authoring
 * type, because in API mode the values arriving here are already RUNTIME
 * messages wearing the authoring type: `useObjectChat` builds them with
 * `uiMessagesToChatMessages(...) as OuiChatMessage[]` (see
 * `useObjectChat.ts`), so at runtime they carry `buildProgress`,
 * `blueprintProgress`, `charts` and tool invocations bearing the HITL /
 * draft-review extensions — every one of which the authoring type erases. A
 * field-by-field rebuild would silently drop the approval cards, the "Review N
 * changes" affordance and the build panel. The cast used to preserve them by
 * accident; the spread preserves them on purpose.
 *
 * The compile-time value of the seam is unaffected by that: a new authored
 * `role` makes {@link toRuntimeRole} unassignable, and a newly REQUIRED runtime
 * key makes {@link authoredToRuntimeMessage}'s return type red. Both are the
 * type error the cast used to swallow.

/**
 * `timestamp: string | Date` -> `string | undefined`.

 * The authoring schema declares `z.union([z.string(), z.date()])`, and the
 * runtime renders `{message.timestamp}` straight into a React child — a `Date`
 * there is the classic "Objects are not valid as a React child" throw.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE expression of that absorption in the package: it was
 * inlined in `useObjectChat`'s `normalizeMessages`, which now calls this
 * function instead (objectui#4399). `normalizeMessages` keeps applying it
 * because the hook's own `messages` output — and the `onSend(content,
 * messages)` callback it feeds — has always handed hosts an ISO string, not a
 * `Date`; the absorption is expressed once here and consumed at both points.
 *
 * The `instanceof` check (rather than an unconditional `.toISOString()`) is
 * deliberate: authored JSON is not type-checked at runtime, so a value that is
 * neither `string` nor `Date` must be dropped rather than thrown on. That is
 * the behaviour the inlined version had.

 * an assistant bubble, with its content shown.** That was already the outcome
 * before this module existed — the cast let `'tool'` reach `<ChatbotEnhanced>`,
 * whose `formatMessageProps` maps everything that is not `'user'` to the
 * assistant bubble — but it was an implicit fallthrough that nothing recorded
 * and nothing tested. It is now a decision this seam makes, by name.
 *
 * Note this is NOT the same decision as `formatMessageProps`: that one maps a
 * runtime role to one of the vendored `<Message>` element's two BUBBLE styles
 * (and folds `'system'` in as well). This one answers a different question —
 * which runtime role an authored `'tool'` message IS. `'system'` keeps its own
 * runtime role here and still renders as the centred system pill in
 * `<Chatbot>`.
 *
 * Changing the rendering of tool messages (a transcript-style tool block, say)
 * is a UX card, not this one; it would start here.

/**

 *
 * The authoring type accepts three extra legacy values and its own doc comment
 * already declares the mapping: "the legacy `partial-call`/`call`/`result`
 * values are kept for back-compat; the AI SDK v6 lifecycle states map cleanly
 * to `input-streaming`/`input-available`/`output-available`". This implements
 * exactly that sentence — the fourth drift the `as any` was hiding, which the
 * issue's table did not list.
 *
 * Rendered-output note: an authored legacy state used to reach `getToolState`
 * unrecognised, which fell through to `'running'` and rendered a status badge
 * with no label. Only schema-authored `toolInvocations` can carry the legacy
 * spelling (API-mode messages come from `mapMessages`, which emits v6 states
 * already), so this is the one place where the seam's honesty changes a
 * rendered result — from a blank badge to the state the author declared.
