## 17.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 09d30a4: Stop declaring 18 `@object-ui/auth` / `@object-ui/components` / `@object-ui/react`
  symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns (objectui#3159, objectstack#4115
  batch 5).

  **Breaking for importers of all three packages** — six exported names changed,
  because the spec exports the same name for a _different_ thing:

  | package      | was                          | now                      | what the spec's same-named export actually is                                  |
  | :----------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `auth`       | `AuthSession`                | `AuthClientSession`      | the SERVER's session record (`{ id, userId, expiresAt: ISO string, token? }`)  |
  | `auth`       | `AuthProviderConfig`         | `AuthProviderOptions`    | an OAuth/OIDC provider registration (`{ id, clientId, clientSecret, scope? }`) |
  | `components` | `FilterCondition`            | `FilterBuilderCondition` | the recursive ObjectQL predicate AST (`$and`/`$or`/`$not`)                     |
  | `components` | `Field`                      | `FieldContainer`         | an object FIELD's metadata and its builder namespace                           |
  | `react`      | `ConflictResolutionStrategy` | `ConflictResolution`     | the metadata-MERGE policy (`error \| priority \| first-wins \| last-wins`)     |

  The `react` rename is the odd one out: the new name is the **spec's own** name
  for the union that hook always used, so it is a re-export rather than a dialect.

  Eleven more keep their names and are now **imported or derived from the spec**
  instead of re-declared: `TenancyPosture`, `DelegableScope` (+`DelegableAdminScope`),
  `AuthUser`, `ShareLinkPermission`, `ShareLinkAudience`, `ShareLink`, `SortItem`,
  `OfflineStrategy`, `OfflineCacheConfig`, `OfflineSyncConfig`, `OfflineConfig`,
  `NavigationConfig`.

  **Three of the copies were losing information, not just duplicating it.**

  - `AuthUser` never declared the spec's `positions` or `tenantId` — the
    authorization inputs. Its `[key: string]: unknown` index signature meant the
    omission was invisible at every call site _and_ to any structural comparison
    (the objectstack#4075 mechanism). It now `extends` the spec principal, so the
    display-only fields (`image`, `role`, `roles`, `emailVerified`) are the delta
    and the spec's keys arrive on their own.
  - `useNavigationOverlay`'s copy carried the note _"inline … to avoid importing
    from `@object-ui/types` (which may not be a direct dependency of
    `@object-ui/react`)"_. The vocabulary belongs to `@objectstack/spec`, which
    **is** a direct dependency — the same expired "kept local to avoid a
    dependency" comment objectui#3169 found in `@object-ui/app-shell`.
  - `useOffline` and `usePerformance` both opened with _"Types aligned with
    `@objectstack/spec` v2.0.7"_. The installed spec is 17.0.0-rc.1.

  `ShareLink` derives from the spec row **minus `password_hash`** — omitted rather
  than optional, because it is the credential itself and typing it in a browser
  package is an invitation to render it. `password_protected` (the boolean the UI
  needs in its place) is the one local addition.

  The config types derive from each schema's **input** side, not `z.infer`.
  `useOffline(config: OfflineConfig = {})` defaults to the empty object, which the
  output type — every `.default()`ed key required — would reject outright.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/components`: its public type surface now references the spec.

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

### Patch Changes

- fc60ad3: refactor(auth): derive the org-role vocabulary from `@objectstack/spec` instead of mirroring it

  `org-roles.ts` restated the four membership-role names that `@objectstack/spec`
  owns as `BUILTIN_MEMBERSHIP_ROLES`. That was a mirror for packaging reasons
  only: this package took no dependency on the spec, and no published spec
  carried the constants. Both blockers are gone — `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0-rc.0`
  ships ADR-0108's closed vocabulary and the workspace already pins
  `^17.0.0-rc.0` — so the four `ORG_ROLE_*` constants are now re-exports,
  `OrgRole` is `BuiltinMembershipRole`, and `ORG_ROLES` is
  `[...BUILTIN_MEMBERSHIP_ROLES]`. The list cannot drift from what the server's
  enforced `select` accepts, by construction.

  Deliberately still local: `ORG_ROLE_LABELS` and the grade ladder
  (`orgRoleGrade` / `invitableOrgRoles` / `assignableOrgRoles`). They are console
  concerns — i18n keys and screen-narrowing rules — and folding them into the
  name list would be the modeling error ADR-0108 D4 warns about: _what names
  exist_ is a list; _which names mean authority_ and _how a name projects_ are
  rules that belong next to what they govern.

  The #2907 drift guard (`is EXACTLY the framework four`) is dropped — a derived
  list cannot drift, and asserting a re-export against a literal is noise. No
  behaviour changes: the four names, their display order, and their labels are
  exactly what they already were.

## 17.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b4bc94: feat(console): group tenancy posture affordances — org switcher as write
  context + org attribution in read views (framework ADR-0105 Phase 1)

  Under the new `group` tenancy posture the server widens reads to every
  organization the member belongs to (`organization_id IN accessible_org_ids`)
  while writes land in the ACTIVE organization — so the console's existing
  "which org am I in = which org's data I see" presentation becomes wrong the
  moment a deployment switches postures. The ADR requires these affordances to
  land WITH Phase 1, not after.

  - `@object-ui/auth`: `AuthPublicConfig.features.tenancyPosture`
    (`'single' | 'group' | 'isolated'`, exported as `TenancyPosture`) mirrors
    the server's public auth config key. It gates nothing — `multiOrgEnabled`
    stays the capability flag; this only tells the console how to render org
    context.
  - `useTenancyPosture()` (app-shell): reads the posture from the cached auth
    config fetch; `undefined` (older server, unrecognized value, fetch failure)
    keeps every group affordance off, so non-group deployments render
    pixel-identical to today.
  - `WorkspaceSwitcher`: under `group` the dropdown labels the active org
    "Working organization" and explains the split — new records are created
    here, views show data from all your organizations.
  - `RecordFormPage` (create mode): org-walled objects show a "Creates in
    <active org>" badge naming the engine's write target (ADR-0105 D5 stamps
    `organization_id` from the active org).
  - Default list columns (`ObjectView`, `InterfaceListPage`, `ObjectDataPage`):
    under `group`, org-walled objects get a TRAILING `organization_id`
    attribution column so cross-org rows are attributable at a glance.
    Render-time only — never persisted into saved view/page metadata, and
    business fields still lead.

- 54886ca: feat(console): make the `delegated_admin` org role reachable, and narrow both role pickers to what the server will accept (framework#3697)

  The framework registered a fourth organization role — `delegated_admin`, the
  grade that may reach `/organization/invite-member` **without** being an org
  admin, which is what finally gives ADR-0105 D8's scope-bounded issuance gate a
  caller. objectui#2868 already shipped the placement half of that UX (units and
  positions narrowed by `describeDelegableScope()`), but the console could not
  select the role in the first place: `MembersPage` and `InviteMemberDialog` each
  inlined `type Role = 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member'`, so the capability the
  framework grew was unreachable from either screen.

  **One vocabulary, not two.** The role names, labels and narrowing rules now live
  in `@object-ui/auth`'s new `org-roles` module (`ORG_ROLES`, `ORG_ROLE_LABELS`,
  `orgRoleGrade`, `invitableOrgRoles`, `assignableOrgRoles`) and both screens
  consume it. Note this list still **mirrors** the server rather than deriving
  from it — `/auth/config` publishes feature flags but no role vocabulary, so
  there is no surface to read; objectstack-ai/objectstack#3723 tracks making one
  list the source for all of them. Until then a server-side role addition means
  one console edit instead of two.

  **The pickers now narrow, the way the placement picker already does.** Both
  mirror a _different_ server gate, and offering an option the server would refuse
  is the failure they prevent:

  - **Invite role** ← the framework's `beforeCreateInvitation` role cap: never
    above the issuer's own grade, and an issuer below admin grade may invite as
    `member` only. A `delegated_admin` who picked "Admin" would have been refused
    with a 403; that option is simply no longer offered.
  - **Change role** ← better-auth's `update-member-role` route: it requires the
    `member:["update"]` permission (owner/admin only — `delegated_admin` is built
    from `memberAc` and holds `member: []`), and only an owner may set `owner` or
    re-role an existing owner. An actor who may re-role nobody now gets no items
    instead of three that would 403.

  Narrowing is convenience, not the boundary — the server re-checks every one of
  these — and it fails toward _less_: an unresolved membership offers `member`
  alone on invite, and nothing on re-role.

  An ordinary invitation is unchanged: with the default role and no placement, the
  request body is byte-identical to before.

  Note for translators: `organization.roles.*` has never been defined in any
  locale bundle — all four labels (owner/admin/member included) resolve through
  their `defaultValue` English fallback. The new role follows the same pattern
  rather than being the only localized one.

- b5609cb: feat(console): scoped-invitation placement — invite someone straight into a
  business unit and positions (framework ADR-0105 D8)

  An invitation may now carry PLACEMENT INTENT: the business unit the invitee
  lands in and the positions they are assigned when they accept. A plant admin's
  invitee arrives already in the right unit and role instead of waiting on a
  platform admin to finish the job by hand.

  - `@object-ui/auth`: `inviteMember` accepts optional `businessUnitId` /
    `positions` (passed through better-auth's invitation `additionalFields`), and
    a new `describeDelegableScope()` reads
    `GET /api/v1/security/my-delegable-scope`.
  - `InviteMemberDialog`: an optional "Placement" section listing **only** the
    units the issuer may place into and the positions they may hand out.
    Positions appear once a unit is chosen — an unanchored assignment is refused
    by the server, so offering it first would mislead.

  The narrowing is convenience, not the boundary: the server authorizes the pair
  against the ISSUER's `adminScope` (ADR-0090 D12) at issuance and rejects the
  whole invitation when it is out of scope. Accordingly the section is **hidden**
  whenever the caller has no delegable authority, or the deployment exposes no
  delegated-administration runtime at all (the endpoint answers 501 ⇒ `null`) —
  never a form the server would refuse. An ordinary invitation is unchanged: with
  no placement chosen, the request body is byte-identical to before.

### Patch Changes

- 503d3f6: docs(auth): the org-role vocabulary is closed — correct the mirror's standing instruction (framework ADR-0108)

  `org-roles.ts` carried a standing instruction that is now wrong: _"a role added
  server-side must be added HERE too."_ There are no server-side additions left
  to chase.

  The framework used to register every declared `position` / `permission` name as
  an organization role, so the console's list could always fall behind the
  server's. That channel was retired (framework ADR-0108, objectstack#3723):
  every value stored in `sys_member.role` is projected into
  `current_user.positions`, so a business role handed out that way was capability
  with none of the position system's controls — no `granted_by`, no validity
  window, no scope check. `sys_member.role` is now a closed, framework-owned list
  of `owner` / `admin` / `delegated_admin` / `member`, and an app's own business
  roles are positions, granted through `sys_user_position` or an invitation's
  placement (framework ADR-0105 D8).

  So this mirror is now complete **by construction** rather than by vigilance.
  Nothing about the console's behaviour changes — the four names and their labels
  are what they already were.

  Still a mirror rather than a derivation, but only for a packaging reason now:
  the names live in `@objectstack/spec` as `BUILTIN_MEMBERSHIP_ROLES` /
  `BUILTIN_MEMBERSHIP_ROLE_OPTIONS`, which `@object-ui/auth` cannot import yet —
  this package takes no dependency on `@objectstack/spec`, and those constants
  ship in the first release carrying ADR-0108 (they are absent from the published
  16.1.0). A new test pins the list to exactly those four in display order until
  then, so drift fails loudly instead of silently offering a value the server's
  enforced `select` would reject.

### Minor Changes

- 803558e: feat(data): thread the host's authenticated fetch into `provider: 'api'` data sources (#2725)

  `provider: 'api'` view data sources went through a bare `globalThis.fetch`, so
  custom endpoints (gantt composite trees, report aggregates) carried only
  same-origin cookies while every native `/api/v1/*` request carried
  `Authorization: Bearer` — the moment cookie HMAC verification failed (dev
  restart rotating the fallback auth secret, cookie expiry/rotation in prod)
  those views 401'd while the rest of the app kept working.

  - **`@object-ui/react`** — `SchemaRendererProvider` accepts an optional
    `apiFetch`; nested providers inherit it from their parent so re-wrapped
    subtrees (react pages, preview surfaces) keep the host's authentication.
    `useViewData` defaults the api-provider adapter's fetch to the context
    `apiFetch` (explicit `adapterOptions.fetch` still wins).
  - **`@object-ui/auth`** — `createAuthenticatedFetch` gains a
    `sameOriginOnly` option: cross-origin URLs pass through to the bare fetch
    with no `Authorization` / `X-Tenant-ID` / `Accept-Language`, so metadata-
    supplied third-party URLs never see the platform token.
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — the console wires
    `createAuthenticatedFetch({ sameOriginOnly: true })` (settle-signal wrapped)
    as `apiFetch` on the root `SchemaRendererProvider`.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-gantt`** — `ObjectGantt` resolves its api-provider
    DataSource with the context `apiFetch`, covering reads and write-backs.

  Behaviour is unchanged for hosts that don't provide `apiFetch` (bare fetch +
  cookies, as before).

### Patch Changes

- 45c6fb4: Login-page auth-config hardening (#2625, #2626):

  - `createAuthClient.getConfig` now single-flights + caches the `/auth/config`
    fetch (the login page's three consumers used to fire three requests) and
    retries failures with backoff (500ms/1.5s/3.5s, 8s per-attempt abort) before
    rejecting. A cold-starting environment kernel no longer strands the page
    without its SSO buttons; a final failure clears the cache so later callers
    retry.
  - `LoginForm` holds a spinner instead of painting the password-form defaults
    while config resolves — an SSO-only deployment must never flash a password
    wall at JIT users who have no password. A failed config still falls back to
    the password form (break-glass beats lock-out).
  - `signInWithProvider` gains a 20s watchdog: a sign-in request that hangs now
    rejects with a clear timeout error so the provider button recovers instead
    of spinning forever.
  - Removed LoginForm's duplicate "or" divider — SocialSignInButtons already
    renders its own, and the stacked pair read as a rendering glitch.

- 077e45b: `signInWithProvider` with `type: 'oidc'` now signs in through better-auth's
  core social route (`POST /sign-in/social`) and only falls back to the legacy
  `POST /sign-in/oauth2` endpoint when the social route rejects the provider.

  better-auth ≥ 1.7 restructured the `genericOAuth` plugin: generic OAuth/OIDC
  providers are injected into the core social sign-in flow and the dedicated
  `/sign-in/oauth2` endpoint no longer exists. The old client therefore 404'd on
  every "Continue with ObjectStack" click (platform SSO broken end-to-end on
  current framework). The fallback keeps the button working against older
  (< 1.7) servers during the coordinated rollout; when both routes fail, the
  social-route error is surfaced since on a ≥ 1.7 server it is the real failure.

- 022735f: RegisterForm: drop the duplicate "or" divider (matching the LoginForm fix in
  #2629). SocialSignInButtons already renders its own "or continue with email"
  divider under the provider buttons; RegisterForm stacked a second "OR" line on
  top, which read as a rendering glitch on the sign-up page.

- 6b2d74e: fix(auth): gate the device-approval page on `features.deviceAuthorization` (framework#2874 / #2513)

  `DeviceAuthPage` hit the RFC 8628 `/device*` endpoints unconditionally, even
  though the better-auth `deviceAuthorization` plugin is opt-in (off by default) —
  so on a deployment without it the page rendered an approve form that only failed
  on submit. It now reads `features.deviceAuthorization` from the public auth
  config and shows a plain "not enabled" notice when the capability is off,
  matching the "form follows plugin" honesty guard the framework side introduced
  in #2874. `AuthPublicConfig.features` gains the `deviceAuthorization` flag
  (previously absent from the client type). A config-fetch error fails open so a
  transient blip never hides a legitimately-enabled page.

### Minor Changes

- 94d00d4: feat(auth): phone number + password sign-in on the login page

  The login page's password mode now accepts an **email OR a phone number** as the
  identifier and routes by shape — email → `/sign-in/email`, phone →
  `/sign-in/phone-number` (better-auth phoneNumber plugin, framework#2780). It
  coexists with the existing phone-OTP mode.

  - Gated on `features.phoneNumber` (phoneNumber plugin enabled). Unlike phone-OTP
    it needs no SMS service, so it uses that coarser capability flag, not
    `features.phoneNumberOtp`. When the flag is off the field stays email-only.
  - New `AuthClient.signInWithPhonePassword(phoneNumber, password)` wired through
    `AuthContext` / `AuthProvider` / `useAuth`.
  - New `normalizePhoneIdentifier` / `looksLikePhoneIdentifier` helpers that mirror
    the backend's `normalizePhoneNumber` exactly (strip `[\s\-().]`, validate
    `^\+?[0-9]{6,15}$`, **no** forced E.164 / country code — the backend stores the
    light-stripped form, so anything heavier would break the lookup).
  - SSO stays email-only (a phone-shaped identifier no longer attempts domain
    routing).

  Only works for accounts that have both a phone number and a password set;
  phone-only accounts set a password on first OTP sign-in.

### Patch Changes

- 53c40c2: feat: identity import — the stock ImportWizard now drives sys_user bulk import (framework#2782)

  The Users list gets an Import entry for platform admins (gated on
  `features.admin` from `/api/v1/auth/config` plus workspace-admin), wired to
  the dedicated `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/import-users` pipeline instead of the
  generic data import (which would bypass better-auth hashing and produce
  accounts that can never sign in).

  - **plugin-grid**: two generic, backend-agnostic ImportWizard slots —
    `extraOptionsContent` (host-injected options on the preview step) and
    `renderResultExtra` (host-rendered content on the result step).
  - **app-shell**: identity import dataSource adapter — splits files into the
    endpoint's ≤500-row batches (idempotent upsert makes re-runs safe), injects
    the selected password policy, renumbers per-batch results onto the whole
    file, and enriches rows with their sign-in identity. Password policy panel
    (`none` default / `invite` / `temporary`) and a one-shot temporary-password
    reveal with CSV download (client memory only — nothing is persisted).
    Async-job/undo surfaces are hidden for identity import by design.
  - **auth**: `AuthPublicConfig.features.admin` typing.
  - **i18n**: en/zh strings for the identity import panels.

### Minor Changes

- 6fb6738: Auth: remediation overlay for the ADR-0069 session gate (enforced MFA / password expiry)

  The ObjectStack backend now blocks logged-in users from protected resources with `403 { error: { code: 'MFA_REQUIRED' | 'PASSWORD_EXPIRED' } }`. The Console now detects this on every API response and raises a full-screen, guided remediation flow instead of leaving the user on failing requests.

  - `@object-ui/auth`: the authenticated fetch wrapper detects the gate and broadcasts it via a tiny module-level emitter; `AuthProvider` exposes `remediationRequired` + `setRemediationRequired`; the `twoFactorClient` plugin is enabled and `enrollTotp` / `verifyTotp` are added to the auth client (`changePassword` already existed).
  - `@object-ui/app-shell`: a `RemediationOverlay` (mounted in `ConsoleShell`) renders the guided flow — change an expired password, or enrol an authenticator (password confirm → QR + backup codes → verify TOTP) — then reloads so the app re-fetches cleanly. Auth + metadata + `me/*` reads stay reachable (server allow-list), so the overlay renders above a normally-loading shell.

### Patch Changes

- cf746c9: fix(auth): only render the "Sign in with SSO" button when the server reports it

  `LoginForm` rendered the SSO button unconditionally, so a deployment without
  enterprise SSO wired (the default for self-hosted / `os dev` local runs) showed
  a button whose `POST /sign-in/sso` route isn't mounted — clicking it surfaced
  the misleading "No SSO provider is configured for this email domain." only at
  click time.

  The button is now gated on `features.sso` from `GET /auth/config`, mirroring how
  `SocialSignInButtons` already gates social providers. It defaults to hidden, so a
  failed config fetch or an older server that doesn't report the flag simply omits
  the button rather than offering a dead end. Requires the matching
  `@objectstack/plugin-auth` change that surfaces `features.sso`.

### Minor Changes

- 18d0339: Relabel metadata-driven UI on a language switch without a page refresh (#1319)

  Switching the UI language left server-resolved metadata labels (object/field/
  view labels, action-dialog text) in the old language until a hard refresh,
  because renderers cache those labels by object name and never refetch on a
  language change.

  **`@object-ui/auth`** — `createAuthenticatedFetch` now folds the active
  `<html lang>` into `Accept-Language` on API calls (never clobbering an explicit
  header), so a switch carries the new locale on every subsequent request.

  **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `ConnectedShellInner` drops the adapter's
  locale-blind metadata cache in the render phase and remounts the metadata
  subtree via `key={language}`, so every renderer refetches in the new locale.
  The adapter and its connection sit above the key and are preserved — an in-app
  relabel, not a reconnect.

  **`@object-ui/i18n`** — dev-mode missing-key warnings: `createI18n` gains
  `warnMissingKeys` (default on outside production) wiring a deduped i18next
  `missingKeyHandler`. `useObjectLabel`'s convention-key probes are flagged so
  their intentional misses (which fall back to server metadata) stay silent.

  Pairs with the framework-side locale-aware metadata changes in
  `@objectstack/client` / `@objectstack/objectql` / `@objectstack/rest`.

### Patch Changes

- f011479: getSession self-heals a stale localStorage bearer: an invalid `auth-session-token` used to SHADOW a perfectly valid cookie session — SSO landings (e.g. the cloud console's sso-exchange into a tenant environment) only set the cookie and cannot touch the target origin's localStorage, so users with a leftover token bounced back to the login page forever. On a bearer get-session miss the client now retries once cookie-only: a live cookie session wins (its token replaces the stale one); an affirmative double-miss drops the dead token; transport errors keep it. getSession also no longer throws on network errors (better-fetch rethrows them).

- 3d58eaa: fix(auth,app-shell): hide Log out menu item when auth is disabled (guest/preview mode)

  When the console runs against a server with `discovery.services.auth.enabled === false`
  (or in preview mode), `AuthProvider` hardcodes `isAuthenticated: true` and the mock
  `signOut()` has no real backend. Previously, clicking "Log out" in the user menu had
  no visible effect — the user/session were nulled but the UI stayed authenticated.

  Changes:

  - **`@object-ui/auth`** — added `isAuthEnabled: boolean` to `AuthContextValue`
    (`true` only when real auth is in use, `false` for guest/preview modes).
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `AppHeader` and `AppSidebar` now hide the "Log out"
    menu item entirely when `!isAuthEnabled`, so users aren't presented with an action
    that can't actually do anything. Also fixed two missed i18n strings in
    `AppSidebar` ("Settings", "Log out").
  - **`@object-ui/i18n`** — added `user.{profile,settings,logout}` namespace to all
    10 built-in locales (en/zh translated; ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/ru/ar fall back to
    English pending native translation).

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
