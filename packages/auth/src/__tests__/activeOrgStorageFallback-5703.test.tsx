/**
 * `ActiveOrganizationStorage`: the in-memory fallback must be REACHABLE in the
 * browser state it was written for — `localStorage` present, reads fine,
 * rejects writes (objectui#5703).
 *
 * Safari private browsing and any quota-exhausted origin present exactly that
 * shape: `getItem` works, `setItem` throws `QuotaExceededError`. `set()`
 * already swallows the write failure into `_memoryValue`; before this fix
 * `get()` returned the `localStorage` read UNCONDITIONALLY, so it answered
 * `null` and the value that had just been stored could never be read back. The
 * cost was silent and lasted the whole session: `createAuthenticatedFetch`
 * reads `get()`, so `X-Tenant-ID` was never stamped on any request.
 *
 * ## The constraint these cases exist to PIN
 *
 * The repair is "prefer a non-null `localStorage` read, else fall back to
 * `_memoryValue`" — and the half that matters is the one that must NOT happen:
 * **sign-out's `clear()` must not be resurrected by that fallback.** A fallback
 * keyed on "the read came back null" is, on its own, exactly the shape that
 * re-stamps a cleared org — after `clear()` the `localStorage` read is null by
 * construction, so the fallback fires, and whatever `_memoryValue` still held
 * goes back on the wire. What makes it safe here is a property of `clear()`,
 * not of `get()`: `clear()` nulls `_memoryValue` BEFORE it touches
 * `localStorage`. That property is load-bearing for a security-relevant path,
 * so these cases pin it directly (`_memoryValue` asserted null after `clear()`,
 * not merely `get()`), rather than reading it off the current source and
 * trusting it to stay. If someone later makes `clear()` only remove the
 * persisted key, `clear-then-get` below goes red instead of silently
 * resurrecting the org.
 *
 * Lives as `.test.tsx` so it runs under happy-dom alongside
 * `createAuthenticatedFetch.test.tsx` — the wire-level cases need `fetch`,
 * `Headers` and a `window.location` for the same-origin check.
