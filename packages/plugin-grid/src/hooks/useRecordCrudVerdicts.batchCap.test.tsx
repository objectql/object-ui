/**
 * [objectui#6286] The cap this hook paginates under IS
 * `@objectstack/spec/security`'s `EXPLAIN_BATCH_MAX_RECORD_IDS` — not a local
 * number that happens to equal it.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, and why asserting the VALUE would not do
 *
 * Until this card the hook declared `const EXPLAIN_BATCH_MAX_RECORD_IDS = 200`
 * locally, and the spec exports `200`. So every assertion on the value passes
 * in BOTH worlds — with the hand copy and with the import. That includes the
 * cap assertion in `../__tests__/rowRecordCrudVerdict.test.tsx`, which reads
 * like a cap test and cannot fail for a drifted cap. A ghost assertion.
 *
 * What the fix actually changes is REFERENCE IDENTITY: the client can no
 * longer drift from the server contract. The only honest way to pin that is to
 * MOVE the spec's export and watch the hook follow — so this file stands the
 * spec module in at a cap no hand copy could produce and asserts the request
 * chunking tracks it. Against the pre-fix hook the stand-in is inert by
 * construction (that module is not in its import graph at all) and every case
 * below fails: it would send one request of seven ids where three are due.
 *
 * The stand-in is a bare package specifier, which
 * `scripts/check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs` does not judge (it resolves RELATIVE
 * specifiers only), so "the mock silently did not install" is guarded here
 * instead — see the control case at the bottom.
