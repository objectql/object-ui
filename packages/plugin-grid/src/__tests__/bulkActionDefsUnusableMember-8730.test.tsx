/**
 * `object-grid.bulkActionDefs` — a member that is not a usable def is SKIPPED
 * and DIAGNOSED, never rendered (objectui#8730).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `bulkActions` and `bulkActionDefs` are one affordance authored in two
 * vocabularies: `bulkActions` members are BARE ACTION NAMES resolved against
 * `objectDef.actions`; `bulkActionDefs` members are FULL `BulkActionDef`
 * OBJECTS used as authored. Nothing refuses a member written in the other
 * vocabulary — both keys are registered `type: 'array'` with no `of`, and both
 * spec rows are `z.array(z.unknown())` — so the read site is the whole member
 * contract.
 *
 * Writing a bare name into `bulkActionDefs` did not fail quietly, it CRASHED:
 * `Array.isArray(schema.bulkActionDefs)` is true, the string travelled into the
 * authored list untouched, `BulkActionBar` rendered a `BulkActionButton` for
 * it, and `def.label ?? formatActionLabel(def.name)` threw
 * `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')` DURING
 * RENDER — the author's first multi-row selection lost the entire selection
 * bar. `key={def.name}` was `undefined` too, so React logged a duplicate-key
 * warning on the way down.
 *
 * ## What is pinned here
 *
 * "Usable" is defined by what the RENDERER READS, not by a fresh opinion:
 * `BulkActionBar` uses `def.name` both as the React `key` and as
 * `formatActionLabel`'s argument, so a member must be an object carrying a
 * non-empty string `name`. One test covers the whole unusable class — the
 * reported bare string, `null`, a number, `{}` and `{ name: '' }`.
 *
 * ⭐ The load-bearing half is the NON-REGRESSION axis, because "skip the bad
 * member" is also satisfied by an implementation that skips EVERYTHING. So the
 * class rows below are paired with rows that fail under exactly that caricature:
 *
 *   - reddens under "skip everything": rows 6 (a mixed list renders exactly the
 *     two good defs, in order, with their labels) and 7 (a clean list is
 *     untouched — same buttons, and the resolved array is the authored array BY
 *     REFERENCE).
 *   - reddens under "skip nothing": rows 1-5 (the class) and row 8's fire leg.
 *
 * The diagnostic is an assertion too, so it is pinned as a PAIR (row 8): it
 * must fire for the bad member and NAME it, and it must NOT fire for a clean
 * list. A warning that fires always is as useless as one that never fires.
 *
 * ## What row 9 inherits
 *
 * objectui#8071's member pin asserted this crash as the CURRENT SHAPE, so that
 * it could not be mistaken for the SILENT drop of the mirror direction
 * (`bulkActions: [{ name: 'approve' }]`, stepped over by `resolveBulkActions`'s
 * `typeof name !== 'string'` guard). That distinction is not deleted by this
 * fix, it is sharpened, and row 9 carries it: both directions now SKIP, but only
 * the def direction is diagnosed. Direction one's silence is asserted here as
 * well — it is deliberately unchanged (objectui#8730's ruling puts it out of
 * scope), and this row is what would notice a diagnostic leaking into it.
 *
 * `selection` is declared explicitly on every row so the ONLY variable between
 * them is the member shape. Left implicit, the grid auto-enables multi-select
 * from `hasBulkActions`, which is itself derived from these two keys — so a
 * row whose members are all skipped would lose its selection UI for the very
 * reason under test and pass without ever reaching the bar.
