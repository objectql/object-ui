 * objectui#6424 — `ObjectGridColumnHolds` after the `headerIcon` hold came out.
 *
 * ## What actually changed, and what this file is for
 *
 * `ObjectGridColumnHolds` exists for keys `data-table` READS that `TableColumn`
 * does NOT declare. `headerIcon` was one until objectui#6615 declared it on
 * `TableColumn`; from that moment the hold was redundant rather than
 * load-bearing, and NOTHING WENT RED — the same silent expiry objectui#6425
 * recorded for `options`. objectui#6424 removed the member.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE REMOVAL MOVED A LIVENESS CLAIM RATHER THAN DELETING ONE. While the
 * hold existed, the emit types declared `headerIcon` on their own account; now
 * they get it ONLY from `TableColumn`. So if `TableColumn` ever stops declaring
 * it, the key silently vanishes from both emit types and `ObjectGrid` goes on
 * writing it at three sites into a slot that no longer admits it. That is a
 * NEW exposure created by the removal, and the first assertion below is what
 * covers it — it is the guard the deleted member used to provide implicitly.
 *
 * ## Why these pins are compile-time
 *
 * The claim is about TYPES, and a rendering test is blind to it: the grid
 * renders exactly as correctly with every type in this file deleted. What can
 * fail is a compile, and `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` reads this file (the
 * package build's own program excludes `__tests__`). The `expect()` calls are
 * there so vitest reports the file at all; the assertions that matter are the
 * `Expect<...>` aliases, which are erased at runtime.
 *
 * ## Every zero here has a positive control in the same query shape
 *
 * A `false` from a probe that can only answer `false` measures nothing, so each
 * negative claim is paired with a sibling that must come back the other way.
