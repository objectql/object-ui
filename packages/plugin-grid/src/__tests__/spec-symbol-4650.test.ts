/**
 * `@object-ui/plugin-grid` ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision tripwire
 * (objectui#4650).
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec/ui` owns `ObjectGridProps` from 17.0.0: it is the AUTHORED
 * props document of the `object-grid` element (`z.input<typeof
 * ObjectGridPropsSchema>` — `label`, `fields`, `defaultFilters`, `pagination`,
 * …), a serialisable authoring surface. This package's same-named interface was
 * the RENDERER's props — a live `dataSource`, host pagination handles, eleven
 * callbacks — so the two are different things under one word, and the local one
 * was renamed to `ObjectGridComponentProps` rather than derived. That is the
 * same verdict, and the same suffix, this repo already reached for
 * `PageHeaderProps` -> `PageHeaderComponentProps` (app-shell) and for the
 * `Record*ComponentProps` family in `@object-ui/types`.
 *
 * A rename only stays a fix while the new name is genuinely free, and an alias
 * only keeps its promise while it denotes the same type. Both are pinned below.
 *
 * ## Why these are compile-time pins and not a runtime name probe
 *
 * The sibling tripwires in app-shell and plugin-list read every `@objectstack/
 * spec` subpath's `.d.ts` through the TypeScript checker, because they need the
 * spec's export names as DATA (they iterate a table of them). Here the question
 * is about two names known at authoring time, so `tsc` can answer it directly —
 * which also keeps this file free of `node:` imports, and so runnable in the two
 * sibling plugins whose `tsconfig.test.json` deliberately does not pull in
 * `@types/node`.
 *
 * The GA half of the ratchet — "the spec still owns `ObjectGridProps`, so this
 * rename still has a reason" — is not asserted here, and deliberately so: this
 * repo is pinned to `^17.0.0-rc.6`, which does not export that name yet (#4636 /
 * PR #4639 raises it). Asserting it would fail on today's `main` for a rename
 * that is exactly what makes the GA tree green. The thing that measures the GA
 * direction is `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` itself.
 *
 * Compiled by this package's `tsconfig.test.json` (objectui#3181) — without
 * that, every `Assert<…>` below is erased before vitest runs and proves nothing.
