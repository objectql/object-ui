/**
 * objectui#6295 — `useRowColor` reached two plain object literals with a bare
 * index, and both inherit `Object.prototype`. The two halves fail differently,
 * so they are pinned separately below:
 *
 *   :67  `config.colors[value]`, where `value` comes from RECORD DATA. An
 *        inherited member is a function, `if (!color)` passes it (truthy), and
 *        `colorToClass` calls `.startsWith` on it — a TypeError thrown inside
 *        the row-className resolver during render. LOUD: the grid crashes, and
 *        the trigger is data, not metadata.
 *
 *   :52  `COLOR_TO_CLASS[lower]`, one call deeper, where `lower` comes from the
 *        AUTHORED colour value. This one never threw: it returned the inherited
 *        member, so a function left the resolver as the row's `className` and
 *        reached React as a class attribute. QUIET, and the same defect.
 *
 * Shape mirrors `packages/plugin-detail/src/headerColor.ts` (objectui#6178 /
 * PR objectui#6294), which guarded the analogous lookup one package over.
