 * the subtraction over-reaches, these are what silently disappear, and no test
 * that renders a grid in this repo would notice (every in-repo host compiles
 * this package's source directly and never loads this sheet). The last three are
 * plain utilities that simply are not in components' sheet.

 * silences a real regression would look exactly like the edit that keeps it
