/**
 * A DISABLED `TextAreaField` cannot be edited through its fullscreen dialog —
 * objectui#3402.
 *
 * `disabled` used to land on the inline `<Textarea>` and nowhere else:
 * `showFullscreenButton` did not consult it, the call site did not forward it,
 * and `FullscreenFieldEditor` did not declare it. Measured on `origin/main`
 * with a probe equivalent to the cases below (the issue itself carried only
 * static evidence, so the premise was reproduced dynamically before any fix):
 *
 *     PROBE textarea: inline disabled = true
 *     PROBE textarea: toggle present = true, toggle disabled = false
 *     PROBE textarea: dialog opened = true
 *     PROBE textarea: dialog input disabled = false
 *     PROBE textarea: onChange calls = [["EDITED WHILE DISABLED"]]
 *
 * That last line is the defect: a disabled field's value changed. The state is
 * nastier than the read-only one precisely because it LOOKS right — the inline
 * control is greyed out, and the only way around it is the button sitting on
 * top of it.
 *
 * This is the registered-path half of the same family #3400/PR #3401 fixed on
 * the built-in `form.tsx` path, and the two are deliberately pinned to the same
 * behaviours so one form-level setting keeps producing one behaviour:
 *
 *   - `readonly` → no affordance at all. Untouched here: this widget's
 *     early-return renders a read-only display before the button is computed.
 *     Pinned below as a NON-REGRESSION, because the fix must not have moved it.
 *   - `disabled` → the button stays but is inert, and the dialog locks on its
 *     own. `disabled` is not only a static flag: the form renderer computes it
 *     as `disabled || fieldDisabled || isSubmitting || …`, so it can flip to
 *     true while the dialog is already open, at which point the button is no
 *     longer the gate.
 *
 * Reachability is not exotic. `ObjectForm` stamps `mobile_fullscreen: true`
 * onto EVERY long-text field when `ObjectFormSchema.mobile.fullscreenLongText`
 * is set, without consulting readonly/disabled, and `stripRegisteredFieldProps`
 * does not strip `disabled` from what registered widgets receive.
