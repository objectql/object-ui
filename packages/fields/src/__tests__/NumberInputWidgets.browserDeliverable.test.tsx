 * objectui#6793 — drive the `type="number"` widget class with what a browser
 * CAN deliver, and assert what the product actually does with it.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * `NumberInputWidgets.environmentDivergence.test.tsx` (objectui#6765) pins that
 * happy-dom does not implement the HTML value-sanitization algorithm, so a
 * `fireEvent.change` in this package can put text in `.value` that no browser
 * ever puts there. That file records the divergence deliberately, as ONE HALF
 * of a disagreement, and says so.
 *
 * What nothing recorded is the other half: **no test in this repository drove
 * these widgets with the values a real browser delivers and asserted the
 * emission.** So the class had a pinned oracle for a fiction and no oracle at
 * all for the product. This file is that oracle, and it is deliberately unable
 * to become the other thing — every string it drives is asserted to be one the
 * platform itself reads without `validity.badInput` (see the last describe).
 *
 * ## What was MEASURED for this file, on this base
 *
 * Chromium 141.0.7390.37 via Playwright 1.62.1
 * (`executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`), a real `<input type="number">`
 * on a real page, driven KEY BY KEY with `keyboard.press`, reading `.value` and
 * `validity.badInput` after every keystroke:
 *
 * ```
 * typed "12abc"  ''  1:'1'  2:'12'  a:'12'  b:'12'  c:'12'
 * typed "1.2.3"  ''  1:'1'  .:'1'   2:'1.2' .:'1.2' 3:'1.23'
 * typed "0x10"   ''  0:'0'  x:'0'   1:'01'  0:'010'
 * typed "1e"     ''  1:'1'  e:''  <- and validity.badInput becomes TRUE
 * typed ""       ''
 * ```
 *
 * ⭐ The load-bearing shape, and the reason this file drives ARRAYS: a browser
 * does not deliver one post-sanitization string, it delivers a SEQUENCE of
 * them, one per accepted keystroke. `"1e"` is the case that makes the
 * difference visible — the box moves `'' -> '1' -> ''`, so React sees a real
 * change and the widget is told to clear. Driving the single value `''` into a
 * box that already reads `''` is not a change at all and emits nothing, which
 * is a different fact about a different user action (see the empty row).
 *
 * The same keystroke runs pasted (`keyboard.insertText`) land on the identical
 * final readings; a programmatic `.value = x` write is a third route and lands
 * on `''` for every one of these strings, with `badInput` FALSE — Chromium
 * reports that it cannot read the USER's input, and a script write has no user
 * input to fail on. That third route is objectui#6780's subject, not this
 * card's; its full matrix is in that card's PR.
 *
 * ## The card's 6-of-10, RE-DERIVED rather than quoted
 *
 * objectui#6793 relayed "the oracle and the product disagree in 6 of 10
 * measured cases" from objectui#6780 / #6765. Re-derived here by driving each
 * case BOTH ways through the real widgets — the fabricated whole string, and
 * the measured browser sequence — the count reproduces exactly, and
 * `divergence.test` below asserts the six by name so the figure cannot rot into
 * a quotation again.
 *
 * ⚠️ The card's other claim does NOT survive re-derivation, and is corrected
 * here rather than repeated: *"every existing unit test for these widgets
 * drives a string no browser can deliver."* Measured across every test file in
 * this repository that renders `CurrencyField`, `PercentField`, `NumberField`
 * or `GeolocationField`, exactly ONE drives such a string —
 * `NumberInputWidgets.environmentDivergence.test.tsx`, which exists to record
 * that divergence. Every other one already drives `'10'`, `'15'`, `'75'`,
 * `'6000'`, `'2'`, `'1234.56'`, `'1234.567'` — all browser-deliverable.
