/**
 * objectui#5498: a readonly `markdown` / `html` / `richtext` form field showed
 * the user the MARKUP SOURCE of their own content.
 *
 * `RichTextField`'s readonly early return rendered `{value}` as a React text
 * child, so a readonly markdown field displayed its asterisks and hashes and a
 * readonly richtext field displayed its tags. The same stored bytes render
 * FORMATTED on every other read surface — grid, kanban card, gallery, related
 * list, dashboard record panel, record detail read mode — because they all
 * dispatch through `getCellRenderer`. One field, two readings, depending only
 * on which surface the user happened to be looking at.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * `readonly-host-plumbing-e2e.test.tsx` already renders the readonly branch of
 * all 34 registered types and was green throughout — it asserts ACCESSIBILITY
 * PLUMBING (accessible name, `aria-describedby` ownership) and nothing about
 * what the branch DISPLAYS. That is exactly why this stayed invisible, so the
 * durable half of the fix is a display pin, and it lives here rather than as
 * one more assertion there: that file's subject is the host↔widget contract,
 * this one's is what a user sees.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and the two negative controls
 *
 * The positive pin is per type, through the REAL form renderer: the formatted
 * elements are present AND the source characters are gone (both halves — a
 * pipeline that renders nothing at all satisfies "no asterisks" too, which is
 * the objectui#5452 failure read from the other side). Then the cross-surface
 * assertion: the form's readonly output is compared, byte for byte, against
 * what `getCellRenderer` produces for the same value — the invariant being
 * restored, stated directly rather than inferred from two separate snapshots.
 *
 * The controls are what keep the fix from being "render everything as HTML":
 *
 *  1. a readonly PLAIN TEXT field still shows its value literally, markup
 *     characters and all — nothing else moved;
 *  2. the html/richtext path is the sanitizing renderer, demonstrably: script
 *     blocks, inline handlers and `javascript:` URLs are stripped from what a
 *     readonly FORM field renders, not just from a grid cell.
 *
 * The widgets are registered raw rather than through `registerAllFields()`,
 * whose `React.lazy` loaders put an unbounded module load inside a bounded
 * `findBy` window — this repo's known flake generator (AGENTS.md 测试纪律,
 * objectui#3010).
