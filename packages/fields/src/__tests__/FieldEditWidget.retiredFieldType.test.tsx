/**
 * Retirement pin — the inline-edit DELEGATION road (objectui#4931, the last
 * measured active-contradiction face of objectui#4814's ruling A′).
 *
 * #4814 retired the `owner` field type with a loud tombstone, and #4914 carried
 * the shrink onto the published contract twins and inline edit. This seam
 * survived all of it. `hasFieldEditWidget` answers
 * `resolveInlineEditType(type) in EDIT_WIDGETS`, and `resolveInlineEditType`
 * returns a type UNCHANGED when it is already a key of `EDIT_WIDGETS` — so
 * while `owner: UserField` sat in that table the alias table was never
 * consulted and the retirement never applied. Measured on this branch before
 * the fix: `hasFieldEditWidget('owner') === true`, and a direct
 * `FieldEditWidget` call rendered a working person picker (one `role=button`
 * reading `Select…`, no tombstone). Deleting a routing-table membership
 * elsewhere does not disable a type; delegation reaches the same widget by
 * another road.
 *
 * What is pinned here is therefore the CLASS, not the spelling. Every
 * assertion below is quantified over `@object-ui/fields`' live
 * `RETIRED_FIELD_TYPES` table rather than written against `owner`, so the next
 * retirement closes this seam the day it lands in that table instead of
 * leaving a fresh delegation road open until someone measures it again.
 *
 * Three roads, three pins, because closing only the first would trade one
 * silent failure for another:
 *
 *  1. `hasFieldEditWidget` — the gate hosts ask before handing a cell to
 *     `FieldEditWidget`. Answers `false`.
 *  2. `isInlineExcludedFieldType` — what the host does NEXT. `ObjectGrid`
 *     marks a column `editable: false` exactly when `isFieldInlineEditable`
 *     (which consults this predicate) is false; otherwise the column stays
 *     editable, the cell editor gets `null`, and DataTable falls back to its
 *     built-in PLAIN TEXT input — which for a stored person reference writes a
 *     bare string over the value. Answers `true`.
 *  3. `FieldEditWidget` called directly, ignoring both gates. Renders no
 *     control at all and writes the once-per-spelling prescription.
 *
 * Both wrong outcomes are pinned in both directions — a working picker (the
 * pre-#4931 state) and a quiet text box (what closing road 1 alone would have
 * produced) — because a test asserting merely "not a UserField" would pass
 * just as happily against the text-box regression.
