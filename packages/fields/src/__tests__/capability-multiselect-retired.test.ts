/**
 * Retirement pin — `field:capability-multiselect` (objectui#3308, ADR-0049
 * enforce-or-remove).
 *
 * The key was registered on ONE path only: `registerFields()`, whose sole caller
 * was the docs site. The live path (`registerAllFields()`, run at module import)
 * never had it, because `fieldWidgetMap` never listed it — so a field authored
 * with `widget: 'capability-multiselect'` resolved to nothing in every real app
 * while a code comment advertised it as usable from a record form. Nothing
 * stamped the hint either: ADR-0056 P1 stamps `permission-facet-link` on all six
 * `sys_permission_set` facets (including `system_permissions`), and P2 put the
 * capability editor in Studio.
 *
 * `registerFields()` itself is gone as of objectui#3910 (ruling B of
 * objectui#3798): the docs catalog's field examples are form-hosted now, so the
 * demo adapter that path existed for has no reason to exist. That REMOVES this
 * file's second and third assertions rather than re-spelling them — a test may
 * not call a function that no longer exists, and asserting over a deleted path
 * would pass for the empty reason (nothing is registered because nothing runs).
 * What each one becomes:
 *
 *   1. absent on the live path — UNCHANGED, and it is now the whole fact. While
 *      a second path existed this assertion pinned nothing (it passed on
 *      `origin/main` too, as PR #3793 recorded); with that path deleted, the
 *      live registry is the only registry, so re-adding the name to
 *      `fieldWidgetMap` is exactly what turns this red.
 *   2. "absent after `registerFields()` too" — DELETED with the path.
 *   3. "registers every other docs-path key" — RE-POINTED at the live path,
 *      which is a superset of the 38 keys the docs path used to register. It
 *      still pins "the retirement subtracts exactly one name", now against the
 *      surviving seam instead of a deleted one.
 *
 * `CapabilityMultiSelectField` the component is deliberately NOT asserted gone:
 * Studio's `PermissionMatrixEditor` imports and renders it directly, which is
 * ADR-0056 P2's design. Only the widget NAME is retired.
