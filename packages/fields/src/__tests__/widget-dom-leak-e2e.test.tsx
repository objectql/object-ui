/**
 * GATE: no field widget may leak a non-DOM prop onto a DOM element
 * (objectui#3291).
 *
 * Every registered field widget is rendered through BOTH hosts, and every
 * attribute of every element it produced is checked against what HTML actually
 * defines. An attribute nobody can explain is a leak.
 *
 * ## What this catches that a unit test cannot
 *
 * The leak was never in one widget. It was structural: a widget spread
 * `{...props}` onto its control, and the hosts hand a widget more than the DOM
 * can take. Measured on `origin/main`, a real form, a real widget:
 *
 * ```
 * <input placeholder="PH-f" zzcanary="CANARY-STR" zzcanaryobj="[object Object]"
 *        zzcanarynum="42" id="…" type="text" value="" name="f">
 * ```
 *
 * `zzcanaryobj="[object Object]"` is an ordinary key an author wrote on the
 * field config. That is why the fix is a WHITELIST (`toDomProps`) and why this
 * test plants canaries rather than checking a list of known-bad names: a
 * blacklist of today's renderer props would pass all three canaries above.
 *
 * ## Four things that silently defeat a test like this
 *
 * 1. **React warnings prove nothing.** React 19 passes an all-lowercase
 *    unknown attribute through in COMPLETE silence. In the audit sweep the
 *    only warning came from a camelCase canary — which was written to the DOM
 *    anyway. So this walks real DOM attributes and never listens for console
 *    output.
 * 2. **Both hosts, or the result is a false pass.** The form renderer strips a
 *    known set before forwarding; `SchemaRenderer` spreads the whole authored
 *    node with NO strip layer, so it leaks strictly more (`label` is only
 *    visible there). On that path the widget's own spread is the only defence.
 * 3. **An error variant that produces no error tests nothing.** `required` +
 *    a `false` boolean does NOT fail here — this repo made `required` a
 *    presence check, so `false` is a value (cloud#972). The audit's first pass
 *    under-reported the `error` leak by one widget for exactly this reason.
 *    Every error variant therefore ASSERTS the message rendered before it
 *    scans; a variant that silently produces no error fails the test.
 * 4. **This repo runs happy-dom, not jsdom** (`vitest.config.mts`), whose IDL
 *    coverage has real gaps — `select[size]`, `option[label]`, `textarea[wrap]`
 *    and `col[span]` are all standard HTML that happy-dom does not reflect.
 *    See `@object-ui/test-support`'s `dom-leak-judge` for how the judge is
 *    built, and its `HAPPY_DOM_IDL_GAPS` for each measured exception and its
 *    reason. Every one of those four was found BY a calibration fixture, not
 *    by guesswork.
 *
 * ## The judge proves itself — next to the judge, not here
 *
 * `isKnownAttribute` / `findLeaks` / `leakReport` are imported from
 * `@object-ui/test-support`, which is where they now live for BOTH DOM-leak
 * gates (objectui#4434). They used to be defined in this file and copied into
 * `packages/app-shell/src/__tests__/widget-dom-leak-sweep.test.tsx`, and the
 * two copies had already drifted.
 *
 * The calibration fixtures moved with them: standard markup that must yield
 * ZERO findings, and markup with planted fake attributes that must ALL be
 * found, now unioned from both gates' fixtures and run once in
 * `packages/test-support/src/__tests__/dom-leak-judge.test.tsx`. When a
 * happy-dom upgrade changes IDL coverage, that fails loudly instead of this
 * sweep going quietly blind — and it now fails in ONE place instead of needing
 * to be discovered twice.
 *
 * ## Deliberate coverage boundary
 *
 * Popovers are NOT opened. Radix needs pointer-capture APIs happy-dom does not
 * implement. Every widget's props spread lands on its inline control (the
 * trigger for a picker), which always renders — so the spread site IS covered,
 * but content that exists only inside an open dropdown is NOT scanned by this
 * test.
 *
 * Widgets are registered from STATIC imports wrapped in `withFieldCarrier`,
 * never via `registerAllFields()`, which wraps every loader in `React.lazy` —
 * an unbounded module load inside a bounded `waitFor` is this repo's known
 * flake generator (AGENTS.md 测试纪律 / objectui#3010).
