/**
 * GATE: every registered field widget must announce a validation failure to
 * assistive tech — `aria-invalid="true"` on some element inside its own form
 * row (objectui#3306, the paradigm of objectui#3291's leak sweep).
 *
 * ## Why a registry-wide sweep
 *
 * This failure class recurs per widget: objectui#3222 fixed seven widgets that
 * computed `aria-invalid` from a prop nobody produced; objectui#3290 fixed the
 * `aria-required` state channel; objectui#3306 fixed `select`, whose Radix
 * `Select.Root` — not being a DOM element — silently swallowed every `aria-*`
 * the form renderer delivered. Each was invisible until someone happened to
 * audit that one widget, because the per-widget tests only cover the widgets
 * someone already fixed. This sweep covers the REGISTRY, so the next widget
 * with a swallowed or missing `aria-invalid` fails here by name instead of
 * shipping.
 *
 * ## The ratchet, and its two ledgers
 *
 * Widgets listed in {@link NOT_YET_DELIVERED} are known not to deliver the
 * attribute today. They are asserted in the OPPOSITE direction — the sweep
 * proves they still do NOT deliver — so fixing one turns its entry red and
 * forces its removal from the ledger. The ledger can only shrink; a widget can
 * never silently regress INTO it, and a fix can never silently go unrecorded.
 *
 * {@link NOT_APPLICABLE} is the OTHER answer, and it is a different claim, not
 * a softer one (objectui#3318 triage). `aria-invalid` is control-channel state:
 * it reports what a user's own editing may do wrong, to the element they would
 * edit. A widget that renders no focusable control has no such element, and
 * marking its text span instead would be precisely the non-focusable-wrapper
 * move this sweep exists to forbid. Those types are not waiting for a delivery
 * that should happen; they are recorded as types where the attribute does not
 * apply, each with the reason in the ledger itself.
 *
 * That second ledger is only safe because a reclassification is FALSIFIABLE.
 * Three structures make "move the row instead of doing the work" fail loudly:
 *
 *  1. `DELIVERING` is DERIVED (`ALL_TYPES` minus both ledgers), so the three
 *     sets partition the registry by construction. Deleting a row from both
 *     ledgers does not retire it — it lands in the positive sweep, which is the
 *     strictest assertion of the three.
 *  2. Every `NOT_APPLICABLE` row carries its own GUARD: the sweep measures that
 *     the widget's row really does offer no focusable control. `grid` cannot be
 *     moved there to tidy the ledger — it renders a button, so the guard goes
 *     red. The same guard is what fails the day someone gives one of these
 *     widgets a real control and leaves the row behind.
 *  3. The two ledgers are asserted DISJOINT and to name only real types, so a
 *     row cannot be double-booked or left pointing at a widget that is gone.
 *
 * What survives in `NOT_YET_DELIVERED` is tracked as follow-up work; this file
 * is the source of truth for what is left.
 *
 * ## Discipline inherited from the #3291 sweep
 *
 * - **An error variant that produces no error tests nothing** — every case
 *   asserts the "is required" message rendered before it reads any aria. The
 *   `required` check is a PRESENCE check (`null` is missing, `false`/`0` are
 *   values — cloud#972), so `null` drives a real failure for every type.
 * - **Popovers are not opened** (happy-dom lacks the pointer-capture APIs
 *   Radix needs); the inline control every widget renders is the surface under
 *   test, which is exactly where `aria-invalid` must sit.
 * - Widgets are registered from STATIC imports wrapped in `withFieldCarrier`
 *   (the real registration seam, objectui#3233), never `registerAllFields()`,
 *   whose `React.lazy` loaders are this repo's known flake generator
 *   (AGENTS.md 测试纪律 / objectui#3010).

/**
 * THE RATCHET LEDGER — widget types MEASURED (by this very sweep, run with an
 * empty ledger) not to put `aria-invalid` on any element of their row after a
 * real validation failure, and which SHOULD. Every entry is a known
 * accessibility gap tracked in objectui#3318, not an accepted state: the field
 * shows its red message while assistive tech is told nothing.
 *
 * The objectui#3318 delivery batch cleared 20 of the original 29 entries with
 * the objectui#3222/#3306 pattern, and the remainder pass cleared `slider` and
 * reclassified seven (see {@link NOT_APPLICABLE}). One is left, and it is the
 * one that needs a DESIGN rather than a spread:
 *
 * - `grid` — composite line-item editor with its own per-CELL `aria-invalid`
 *   for line validation; driving it from a FORM-level failure has no obvious
 *   target (which cell? the add-row button?). It is emphatically NOT a
 *   `NOT_APPLICABLE` candidate: its row DOES offer a focusable control, which
 *   is exactly what that ledger's guard measures.
 *
 * Do NOT add to this list to make a new widget pass; fix the widget (the
 * objectui#3222/#3306 pattern: spread `toDomProps(props)` onto the real
 * focusable control — never a non-DOM Radix Root, never a wrapper — then
 * `aria-invalid={!!error}` after the spread). An entry is removed by fixing the
 * widget: the sweep asserts each entry still fails to deliver, so a fixed
 * widget turns its own ledger row red until it is removed here. The ledger only
 * shrinks.

/**
 * THE SECOND LEDGER — widget types for which `aria-invalid` is not a delivery
 * that is owed, because there is no element that could carry it: the row
 * renders NO focusable control at all (objectui#3318's triage).
 *
 * This is a semantic verdict, so every row states its ground, and the sweep
 * then MEASURES that ground rather than trusting it — see the "no focusable
 * control" case below. A row whose widget grows a real control goes red here
 * and has to move to {@link NOT_YET_DELIVERED} or be delivered outright; a row
 * moved here to escape the first ledger goes red on arrival.
 *
 * Reachability note, because the two ledgers are graded differently: the first
 * ledger judges a VALUE (does the attribute arrive?) and its rows must reach a
 * real rendered control. These rows judge the opposite fact — that no such
 * control exists — so the assertion is about what the row does NOT contain, in
 * the exact state this sweep renders (fresh, empty, required, just failed).
 *
 * That state is named deliberately rather than as a hedge, and it is the whole
 * of what these rows claim. The four read-only types render their EMPTY-value
 * branch here (an `EmptyValue` placeholder, not the formatted-value span), and
 * `signature`'s Clear button becomes focusable only once something has been
 * drawn. Both are the right state to judge: `required` is a PRESENCE check, so
 * the moment the attribute would have to be announced is exactly the moment the
 * value is missing. A row saying "no control, therefore nothing to mark" is
 * saying it about that moment — verified there, and claiming nothing about a
 * filled field, which is not the one failing.
