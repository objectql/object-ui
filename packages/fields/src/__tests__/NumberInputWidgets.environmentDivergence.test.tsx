/**
 * objectui#6765 — the ORACLE for `CurrencyField` / `PercentField` disagrees
 * with the PRODUCT, and until this file nothing said so.
 *
 * Both widgets render `type="number"` inputs and hand `parseFloat(e.target.value)`
 * to `onChange` with no whole-string guard of their own. The card that filed
 * this measured that **happy-dom — this package's test environment — does not
 * implement the HTML value-sanitization algorithm**, and drew the conclusion
 * that any test written for these two widgets exercises a code path no browser
 * takes.
 *
 * ## What this card MEASURED, which the filing card explicitly had not
 *
 * The real browser. Chromium 141.0.7390.37 via Playwright 1.62.1, driving the
 * REAL widgets mounted in a real page, through the routes a user actually has
 * (keystrokes, Ctrl+V paste, and a programmatic value set):
 *
 * ```
 *                     happy-dom                    real Chromium
 * route/input         e.target.value  onChange     box.value  onChange
 * typed  "12abc"      "12abc"         12           "12"       12
 * typed  "1.2.3"      "1.2.3"         1.2          "1.23"     1.23    <- DIFFERS
 * pasted "0x10"       "0x10"          0            "010"      10      <- DIFFERS
 * typed  "1e"         "1e"            1            ""         null    <- DIFFERS
 * typed  ""           ""              (no call)    ""         (no call)
 * el.value = "12abc"  "12abc"         --           ""         --      <- DIFFERS
 * ```
 *
 * Three readings out of five DISAGREE, and they disagree in the direction that
 * matters: a pin written in this environment asserting `"0x10"` yields `0`
 * would be asserting the exact opposite of the product, which yields `10`.
 *
 * ## The consequence that decides this card
 *
 * **Residue never reaches these widgets in a real browser.** The browser
 * filters the keystroke or the paste BEFORE the change event, so by the time
 * `handleChange` runs the text is already a well-formed number — or the empty
 * string. So objectui#6715's anchored `WHOLE_NUMBER_TEXT` guard, which is the
 * right answer for `LocationField` (a `type="text"` box with nothing filtering
 * it), is here a **no-op**: it accepts every string these boxes can produce and
 * rejects only strings this test environment fabricates. That is asserted
 * below against #6715's OWN regex, read out of its source rather than
 * transcribed, so there is no second dialect of "what a number is" and the
 * claim moves if #6715 moves.
 *
 * ⛔ This file deliberately does NOT pin the truncating emissions as product
 * behaviour. `12`, `1.2`, `0` for `"12abc"`, `"1.2.3"`, `"0x10"` are recorded
 * here as ENVIRONMENT ARTIFACTS and asserted only as one half of a
 * disagreement; nothing here says any of them is correct. Freezing them in
 * place is the failure this card exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Reproducing the browser column
 *
 * The harness is not committed — it was a Vite page mounting the two widgets
 * from source, served on a scratch port, driven by Playwright with
 * `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`. The numbers above are quoted
 * in the two widgets' own source comments, which is where the next person
 * reading `parseFloat(e.target.value)` will look.
