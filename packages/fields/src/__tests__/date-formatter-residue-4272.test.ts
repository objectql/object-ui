 * objectui#4272 — the two FORMATTER-level en-US channels the #4468 fix
 * (PR #4512) deliberately left behind.
 *
 * PR #4512 pointed every date *renderer* at `useDisplayLocale()`. It could not
 * reach these two, because both are properties of the formatter's signature
 * rather than of any renderer:
 *
 *   1. `formatDate`'s `'short'` branch hardcoded the tag —
 *      `date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short' })` — so it rendered
 *      an English month name even when a caller DID thread `options.locale`
 *      into the very same call. The sibling default branch two lines below
 *      already honored `options?.locale`; `'short'` was the outlier.
 *   2. `formatDateTime` took no options parameter at all, so no caller could
 *      localize it however hard it tried; it passed `undefined` to `Intl`,
 *      which means "the MACHINE's locale" — neither of the repo's two locale
 *      channels.
 *
 * ── Why these cases live in a file with NO provider ──────────────────────
 * objectui#4514: `useObjectTranslation()` outside a provider reports
 * react-i18next's GLOBAL language, which any `I18nProvider` mounted earlier in
 * the same file leaves behind. These are pure-function cases that touch no
 * hook at all, so they are immune — but they are kept apart from the
 * provider-mounting cases regardless, so the split stays structural rather
 * than something a later edit can quietly erode. The provider-mounted halves
 * of this card live in `RecordPickerDialog.dateLocale.test.tsx`,
 * `plugin-grid/.../mobileCardDateLocale.test.tsx` and
 * `plugin-gantt/.../ObjectGantt.dateLocale.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ── Directions (measured, not presumed) ──────────────────────────────────
 * Runner: node v22.22.2 / ICU 78.2 / TZ=UTC / machine locale en-US.
 * `en` and `en-US` produce an IDENTICAL `{month:'short'}` for all 12 months,
 * so every `en` case below is GREEN ON BOTH SIDES — it is the byte-identical
 * must-not-change pin, NOT red evidence. The `zh` and `de` cases are the ones
 * that actually go red against unfixed code.
