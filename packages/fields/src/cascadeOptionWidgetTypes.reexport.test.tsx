/**
 * objectui#4770 — `@object-ui/fields` re-exports the cascade allow-table, it
 * does not redefine it.
 *
 * The set of widget keys that must be fed the live record (`dependentValues`)
 * is defined once, in `@object-ui/core` next to `resolveCascadingOptions` — the
 * evaluator that reads that record — because core is the only package all three
 * consuming surfaces can depend on (the object form in `@object-ui/components`
 * cannot reach `@object-ui/fields`: that dependency runs the other way). It is
 * surfaced HERE as well because this package's `resolveFormWidgetType` produces
 * the keys the set is keyed on, so a consumer resolving widget keys finds the
 * allow-table where it resolves them.
 *
 * Two doorways, one definition. If someone ever "restores discoverability" by
 * writing a second `new Set([...])` in this package instead of re-exporting,
 * the first assertion fails — while a membership-only check would happily pass
 * on a copy and let the two definitions drift apart later, which is the exact
 * failure objectui#4770 removed.
