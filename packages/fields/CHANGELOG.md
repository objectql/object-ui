# @object-ui/fields

## 13.2.0

### Patch Changes

- e492b9d: Permission sets — pure separation of **design** (Studio) and **assignment**
  (Setup), per ADR-0056 / epic #2398. A `sys_permission_set` used to render its six
  authorization facets in Setup as raw `[Object]` / JSON textareas, and only
  objects+fields were editable in Studio; this reworks both surfaces.

  **Setup (assign + read-only):**
  - The six facets (`object_permissions`, `field_permissions`, `system_permissions`,
    `row_level_security`, `tab_permissions`, `admin_scope`) now render read-only on
    the `sys_permission_set` record page as a compact summary (counts, or capability
    chips) plus a **“Design in Studio →”** deep-link into the structured editor
    (`/apps/:appName/metadata/permission/:setName`, env scope). No `[Object]`, no
    JSON — in the record view, inline edit, and the create/edit form. Implemented as
    a `permission-facet-link` field widget stamped onto the six fields via the single
    `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` choke point and honored by DetailSection +
    the record form.
  - User assignment (add/remove via `sys_user_permission_set`) is surfaced directly
    on the Setup record page.

  **Studio (design every facet):** the permission matrix editor gains structured
  editors for the facets that were JSON-only —
  - **System Capabilities**: a multi-select over the live `sys_capability` registry
    (scope-grouped, labelled chips).
  - **Row-Level Security**: per-policy rows (object · operation · enabled) with CEL
    USING/CHECK.
  - **Tab Visibility**: per-tab `visible | hidden | default_on | default_off`.
  - **Delegated Admin Scope**: business-unit + subtree, manage-assignments /
    -bindings / author-env-sets toggles, and an assignable-permission-sets allowlist.
    Assignment was moved out of the editor (it is now a Setup act) — the editor is
    purely a design surface.

  Storage/types are unchanged; editors read/write the draft’s existing parsed
  fields and tolerate legacy JSON strings on load. Note: env-scope metadata saves of
  these facets do not yet project onto the queryable `sys_permission_set` data
  record the Setup summary reads, so a fresh Studio edit isn’t reflected in Setup’s
  read-only view until the projection refreshes — tracked as a framework follow-up
  (enforcement reads the authoritative metadata).

### Patch Changes

- 6cbccf3: Localize form validation messages, toast client-side validation failures, and make native date/time picker icons legible in dark mode.

  Record-form validation messages (required, min/max length, min/max value, pattern, email, URL) were hard-coded English even when the field label was localized — e.g. a Chinese "计划开始日期" field showed "计划开始日期 is required". `buildValidationRules` baked English strings, so the form renderer's `t(...)` fallback never applied. It now emits `required: true` and, for the other rules, a `messageKey` + `undefined` message (a field-authored `*_message` still wins and passes through verbatim); the form renderer fills the blanks via i18n (`validation.*` keys already exist in every locale), so messages track the label's language.

  When client-side validation blocks a submit, the offending field's inline error can sit below the fold in a long modal/drawer form — the user clicks 创建 and sees nothing happen. The form renderer now also fires a `toast.error` naming the fields (`validation.formInvalid`, added to all 10 locales), mirroring the existing server-error toast so the feedback is visible regardless of scroll position.

  Separately, native controls now declare `color-scheme` (`light` on `:root`, `dark` on `.dark`), so the webkit calendar-picker-indicator and other built-in glyphs render light-on-dark instead of vanishing against the dark input background.

## 12.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 226fde9: Cascading & role-gated `select` options (#2284).

  `select` options now accept a per-option `visibleWhen` CEL predicate — the option
  is offered only when it evaluates TRUE against the live record **plus
  `current_user`** (same engine/env as a field-level `visibleWhen`). Combined with a
  field-level `dependsOn`, this drives dependent selects (country → province → city)
  and role/context gating with no bespoke matrix — the same primitives dependent
  lookups (#2215) already use.

  - `@object-ui/core` exposes `resolveVisibleOptions` / `isOptionGroupGated` /
    `resolveDependsOnFields` / `isValueStillOffered` (evaluator), reusing the
    canonical `evalFieldPredicate`.
  - The form renderer narrows a dependent select's option list, gates the control
    with a "Select {parent} first" hint while a `dependsOn` field is empty, and
    clears a now-invalid value when the parent changes.
  - The standalone `SelectField` widget applies the same resolution via
    `dependentValues` + the global predicate scope.

  Client-side hiding is UX, not authorization: gate authorization-sensitive option
  values on the server too. Aligns with `@objectstack/spec` `SelectOption.visibleWhen`.

### Patch Changes

- e36a9c7: Align the DetailView column density with the entry form (objectui#2578 "多列显示").

  - **Detail views now reach up to 4 columns, matching the form.** `inferDetailColumns` was hard-capped at 2 columns and the section column count was derived per-section, so a field-heavy record displayed 2 columns in detail but 4 in the edit form. It now uses the same density scale as the form's `inferColumns` (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 by field count) and `deriveFieldGroupDetailSections` derives the count from the object's _total_ field count and stamps it uniformly on every section — so view and edit read at the same width. The responsive grid classes and `getResponsiveSpanClass` ladder were extended through the 3- and 4-column breakpoints, and the effective column count is clamped to the number of visible fields so a lone field never sits at 1/N width.
  - **Long JSON values no longer spill into the neighbouring column.** `JsonCellRenderer` (used by `address`/`json`/`object`/`composite`/`record` fields) applied `truncate` to a bare inline `<span>`, where `overflow:hidden`/`text-overflow:ellipsis` never clip (there is no width box) and the accompanying `white-space:nowrap` also defeated the cell's `break-words`; a long name-keyed map or address JSON therefore overflowed into the adjacent GPS/color cell once the grid narrowed to multi-column. The renderer is now a `block max-w-full` element so `truncate` clamps to the cell width (full value still on hover), and the detail cell wrappers carry `min-w-0` so unbreakable values wrap instead of setting the track's min width.

- 68e2d1c: Studio UX audit fixes (objectui#2285) — browser walkthrough of the Studio design surface surfaced one rendering bug and several dead-space/discoverability issues; all fixed and re-verified end to end:

  - **Bug — mobile card view showed `[object Object]` for lookup fields.** `ObjectGrid`'s narrow-viewport card layout dumped raw field values through `String(value)` instead of reusing the type-aware cell renderer the desktop table already used; a lookup's expanded object (`{ id, name }`) rendered as the literal string. Now routed through the shared `coerceToSafeValue` helper (newly exported from `@object-ui/fields`, alongside `pickRecordDisplayName`) and a hoisted `renderRecordDetail`, matching the desktop path.
  - **Studio has no responsive/mobile layout.** Below the mobile breakpoint, each pillar's rail (Objects / Flows / Nav tree / Permission sets) now collapses into a toggleable overlay drawer instead of permanently squeezing the canvas into ~190px, and the top pillar-tab bar scrolls horizontally instead of clipping Automations/Interfaces/Access off-screen.
  - **Records tab / Automations canvas had a dead space band.** `ObjectView`'s built-in "+ New" toolbar row (a separate, mostly-empty flex row above the grid) is now folded into the grid's own toolbar via a new optional `onAddRecord` passthrough on `renderListView`; the Automations canvas container now sizes to the pillar's full height instead of its own intrinsic content height.
  - **Automations "fit view" never actually zoomed in.** `fitToView`'s zoom calculation was hard-capped at 100%, so small (2-4 node) flows stayed stranded in a corner of a mostly-blank canvas even after fitting. Removed the artificial cap (now bounded only by the existing `MAX_ZOOM`) and auto-fit once on mount so opening a flow starts appropriately zoomed instead of a fixed 100%/pan-0,0 default.
  - **Validations tab didn't default-select the first rule**, unlike the Access pillar's Permission Set list — now consistent.
  - **HTML/React "source" pages left the Properties panel permanently empty** (no selectable block exists for raw JSX/HTML pages). It now shows a contextual message pointing at the source editor instead of the generic "click a block" empty state.
  - **Permission matrix column headers (C/R/U/D/Tr/Re/Pu/VA/MA) had no visible legend** — added one above the matrix (the header cells' native tooltips stay as-is).
  - **App Builder landing page** widened and given the same icon-badge treatment as Home's app cards, with a 3-column grid on wide screens instead of a narrow fixed-width column stranded in the corner of the viewport.

### Minor Changes

- 19f2533: Detail-page related lists: `relatedList: 'primary'` → own tab, multi-FK & self-referential related lists, unified picker columns (framework #2579).

  - **plugin-detail** (`buildDefaultTabs`): the default related-list layout is now
    the ADR-0085 prominence rule — lists whose FK declares `relatedList: 'primary'`
    each get their OWN tab; every other related list collapses into a single
    "Related" tab. With no primary lists this is byte-for-byte the previous stacked
    default, so it is opt-in per relationship. `relatedLayout: 'tabs' | 'stack'`
    remain app-level overrides (force all-own-tabs / all-stacked).
  - **app-shell** (`deriveRelatedLists`): emits one related list per eligible FK —
    a child referencing the parent through several relationships (e.g.
    `primary_account` + `partner_account`) now surfaces each, disambiguated by the
    FK label; includes self-referential relationships (hierarchies → a "child"
    list); and carries the `isPrimary` prominence flag through. `RecordDetailView`
    threads `isPrimary` into the synthesized page.
  - **fields** (`deriveLookupColumns`): the lookup-picker default columns now
    prefer the object's ADR-0085 `highlightFields` (then legacy `displayFields`,
    then the field walk) — the same "how to list this object" source the related
    list uses, so a picker and a related list of the same object agree with zero
    per-surface config.

  Pairs with the `@objectstack/spec` change that makes `relatedList` a tri-state
  (`boolean | 'primary'`) and `record:related_list` `columns` optional.

### Patch Changes

- bce581a: Fix dependent (cascading) lookups: unlock on parent selection and enforce the
  cascade filter on every candidate surface (#2215).

  Two breaks made `depends_on` unusable end to end:

  - **The gate never unlocked in create mode.** `LookupField` resolved dependent
    values from `ctx.formValues` — a member `SchemaRendererContext` never had —
    and nothing injected the `dependentValues` prop, so with a fresh record
    (`ctx.data = {}`) the child lookup stayed disabled no matter what the user
    picked in the parent field. The form renderer now injects its live form
    values (the same reactive snapshot that drives field rules) as
    `dependentValues` for data-source fields.
  - **The Level-2 table picker bypassed the cascade.** The `depends_on` chain
    only reached the quick-select popover filter; `RecordPickerDialog` (and the
    search-first `PeoplePicker`) received just `lookup_filters`, listing the full
    unfiltered record set. Both pickers now take a `baseFilter` — a hard
    `$filter` constraint merged after `lookupFilters` and user filter-bar input,
    so it can never be widened back out — and `LookupField` passes the dependent
    chain there, shares the same filter with the popover query, and disables the
    browse-all button while dependencies are missing.

- 5160832: fix(fields): inline-edit relational fields with the standard picker (not a text box)

  Inline cell editing reuses the form's field widgets, but the inline map
  (`EDIT_WIDGETS`) was a hand-maintained subset of the form's (`fieldWidgetMap`)
  and had drifted: **lookup / master_detail / user / owner** had perfectly good
  form pickers yet fell back to a plain text box inline (you'd type a raw record
  id). Wire them up — `lookup`/`master_detail` → `LookupField`, `user`/`owner` →
  `UserField`, the exact widgets the form uses. They read the related-object
  dataSource from `SchemaRendererContext` (which the grid provides), so the
  record picker opens, fetches, and selects inline.

  To stop the two lists drifting again, `index` now exports `FORM_FIELD_TYPES`
  and a drift-guard test pins the contract: every form widget type must have an
  explicit inline decision — an editor in `EDIT_WIDGETS` or an entry in the new
  `INLINE_EXCLUDED_FIELD_TYPES` (computed/binary/heavy/container types, each with
  a reason). A future form widget can no longer silently become a text box (or a
  missing editor) in the grid.

- 69d6b94: feat(fields): inline-edit structured-value fields (color, address, location, geolocation, code, qrcode)

  Completes the inline-editor ↔ form-widget parity from the previous fix: the six
  structured types that already had lightweight form widgets — `color`,
  `address`, `location`, `geolocation`, `code`, `qrcode` — now edit inline with
  those same widgets instead of being deferred. All are dependency-light (no map
  or code-editor libraries) and use the standard `FieldWidgetProps`. Verified
  inline on the field-zoo: color → a color picker, code → a textarea, the rest
  their value editors. The drift-guard's exclusion set now contains only the
  genuinely-non-inline types (computed, binary, heavy editors, containers).

- 243a9ba: fix(fields): inline lookup editor shows the selected record's name (not the "Select…" placeholder)

  When editing a `lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `owner` field inline in the
  data grid, the `LookupField` picker showed the placeholder instead of the
  current record's name. The grid requests `$expand` for visible reference
  columns, so a lookup cell's value arrives as the related record **object**
  (`{ id, name }`) rather than a bare id. The read cell (`LookupCellRenderer`)
  already resolves objects via the display-name path, but the inline editor only
  matched **primitive** ids (`findOption(value)` with a strict `===`), so an
  object value never resolved — and the hydration effect made it worse by calling
  `findOne(referenceTo, <object>)` with a bogus id.

  `LookupField` now resolves an expanded-reference object directly into its
  display option (mirroring the read cell), skips the pointless per-object fetch,
  and normalises object values to their id for option matching / multi-select
  toggle / removal. `FieldEditWidget` also renders the relational pickers
  `compact` inline — the same single-line, borderless trigger the line-item grid
  uses — so the record name shows **in** the trigger instead of a chip stacked
  above a "Select…" button.

- 289be5b: fix(fields): align inline lookup value resolution with the read cell (external-id strings, tolerant id match)

  Follow-up to #2125. `LookupField`'s inline display now resolves every value
  shape the read cell (`LookupCellRenderer`) does:

  - **JSON-encoded external-id references** (`'{"externalId":"Website Relaunch"}'`)
    are parsed and shown by their external id, and excluded from the hydration
    fetch (so we never `findOne` with a raw JSON string). `recordToOption` gained
    an `externalId` fallback for both the value and the label.
  - **Tolerant id matching** — a `String()`-coerced fallback (`findOptionLoose`)
    resolves a numeric cell value against a string-keyed option (and vice versa),
    matching the read cell's `String(a) === String(b)` comparison. Only consulted
    when the strict match misses, so homogeneous option lists are unaffected.

  Also adds explicit inline-editor tests for `user` / `owner` fields (they
  delegate to `LookupField` via `UserField`), completing coverage for the full
  relational set wired inline in #2122.

- 09e1b26: Show inline line-item (master-detail subform) row actions always, not on hover.
  In grid mode the per-row remove (🗑) and duplicate buttons were `opacity-0`
  until the row was hovered (`group-hover`), so they read as "delete not
  supported" and were unreachable on touch / coarse-pointer devices with no hover.
  They now render at full opacity (kept muted via `text-muted-foreground`); the
  action column width was already reserved, so there is no layout shift. Existing
  `allow_delete: false` / `readonly` / `disabled` / `min_rows` gating is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 788dbf9: feat(fields): wire the `user` field picker to a real `sys_user` search

  The `user`/`owner` field widgets previously rendered a placeholder ("User
  selection component requires integration with user management system") and the
  form-type map fell through to `field:text`, so a `user` field rendered as a
  plain text input.

  `UserField` now **delegates to the shared `LookupField`** with the reference
  fixed to `sys_user` — reusing the existing debounced candidate search, the
  record-picker dialog, and id resolution — so selecting a person works the same
  way as any lookup, with zero bespoke data plumbing. `mapFieldTypeToFormType`
  now maps `user`/`owner` to `field:user`/`field:owner`, satisfying the existing
  `field-type-coverage` regression guard (which already listed both but had no
  mapping wired — the widget map and cell renderers were registered, the form-type
  map was the missing link). Table-cell display continues to use `UserCellRenderer`
  (avatars/initials).

  Pairs with the framework `user` field type (a lookup specialized to `sys_user`).

### Minor Changes

- 5332639: feat(app-shell): render full object forms (incl. master-detail) in screen-flow wizard steps

  `FlowRunner` now renders an `object-form` screen step: when the paused screen
  carries `kind: 'object-form'`, it mounts the real `<ObjectForm>` for the named
  object (auto-routing to `MasterDetailForm` for inline child collections),
  prefilled from the step's `defaults`. The form persists itself (atomic
  master-detail batch), then resumes the run with the saved record id bound to the
  step's `idVariable`. `dataSource`/`objects` are threaded through all three
  `FlowRunner` mount points.

  Also fixes three pre-existing bugs this surfaced (each affects normal forms too):

  - **plugin-form**: `ObjectForm` now forwards `initialValues`/`initialData` when
    routing to `MasterDetailForm`, so prefilled header values are no longer
    dropped on master-detail create forms.
  - **fields**: `PercentField` treated values as `0–1` fractions (`value × 100`),
    so a `0–100` field (e.g. `probability` default `50`) rendered as `5000%` —
    exceeding `max=100`, which makes HTML5 constraint validation mark the field
    `:invalid` and silently block the whole form's submit. It now treats a field
    declaring `max > 1` as the `0–100` whole-number convention, matching the
    read-side formatter.
  - **data-objectstack**: `ObjectStackAdapter.batchTransaction` now sends
    `credentials: 'include'`, so master-detail batch saves authenticate under the
    console's cookie session (previously every batch save 401'd).

- 66ed3ad: Line-item grid: item-typeahead auto-fill from a lookup column.

  When a lookup cell's record is picked, `GridField` now copies any of the chosen record's fields whose names match a sibling column (e.g. a product's `unit_price` / `description` drop into the row), then recomputes computed columns — the catalog-typeahead behaviour of QuickBooks / Stripe / NetSuite. Opt out per column with `autofill: false`. `LookupField` gains an optional `onSelectRecord(record)` callback that surfaces the full selected record (not just its id). New pure export `lookupAutofillPatch(columns, col, record)`.

- c6445b6: Line-item grid: inline validation, duplicate, and drag-to-reorder.

  - **Inline per-cell validation** — a required, non-computed cell that's empty on a real (non-ghost) row flags red in place (`aria-invalid` + ring), so errors are visible without submitting.
  - **Duplicate row** — a hover Copy action clones a line (id stripped) directly below it, for near-identical lines.
  - **Drag-to-reorder** — a hover grip handle reorders rows via native drag-and-drop. Set `sort_field` on the grid config to persist order (`row[sortField] = index` stamped on every change); otherwise reorder is order-of-entry.

- 80c133c: Spreadsheet-style line-item grid editor.

  `GridField`'s editable grid mode is reworked into an enterprise line-item editor (the QuickBooks / Stripe / NetSuite pattern), generalised across every inline grid:

  - **Computed read-only columns** — a child field with an arithmetic `expression` (e.g. `amount = quantity * unit_price`) renders read-only, recomputes live as its inputs change, and writes the result back into the row so it persists and the running total reflects it. A small safe arithmetic evaluator (`+ - * / %`, parens, `record.<field>` refs; no `eval`) powers it.
  - **Trailing "ghost" row** — start-with-one + auto-append: typing in the ghost materialises a real row (index-stable, so focus/caret survive), so you keep entering lines without clicking "Add".
  - **Borderless click-to-focus cells** + role-based column widths (description flexes; qty/price/amount stay narrow).
  - **Keyboard navigation** — Enter / ArrowUp / ArrowDown move between rows in the same column.
  - Per-row "expand to full form" is gated to grids that omit fields (no redundant expand on thin lines).
  - `deriveColumns` surfaces a field `expression` as a computed column; the running-total column prefers the computed/last-currency column. Blank/ghost rows are filtered from the persisted batch (`isBlankRow`).

- 5e1b838: Lookup cells in line-item grids. `LineItemsField` columns now support `type: 'lookup'` (with `reference` / `displayField` / `idField`), rendering a real lookup picker per cell that resolves display labels and stores the foreign-key id — so master-detail line grids can reference other objects (category, account, assignee, …) instead of only plain selects.
- 90acb7f: Master-detail subform + lightweight list primitives (SDUI).

  - `MasterDetailForm` (`object-master-detail-form`): enter a parent record and its child line items together; client-orchestrated transactional create (parent → FK → bulk children → rollup → cleanup). Enterprise-convention layout (header on top, line grid, single Save bar at the bottom).
  - `LineItemsField` editable child grid (line numbers, right-aligned numerics, running total) and `LineItemsPanel` (`record:line_items`) for detail-page inline edit.
  - `element:definition-list` and `element:repeater` — lightweight, low-chrome list primitives for simple data.

- 18728c1: Master-detail entry: lighter layout, compact lookup cells, persisted line order.

  - **De-framed line-item section** — the subform no longer double-frames the grid in a `Card` (border + `p-6`); it renders as a light label + the grid's own bordered table, reclaiming the width the line table needs.
  - **Compact lookup cells** — `LookupField` gains a `compact` mode (used by grid cells): the selected value shows inline in a borderless single-line trigger instead of a chip stacked above a separate "Select…" button.
  - **Persisted drag-reorder** — `deriveMasterDetail` detects a sort field (`position`/`sort_order`/…), excludes it from the editable columns/row-form, and threads it as the grid's `sort_field` so reordering stamps `row[position] = index` and survives a reload.

### Patch Changes

- 2d47e94: B2 follow-ups (A): field conditional rules in inline grids + submit-time enforcement.

  - **Grids**: a line-item column's `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` CEL rule is now honored per row — `deriveMasterDetail` carries the props onto the `GridColumn` and `GridField` evaluates them against each row via `resolveFieldRuleState` (a `readonlyWhen`-TRUE cell locks; a `requiredWhen`-TRUE empty cell flags inline-invalid). Rules are row-scoped (`record.*`); the core helpers gained an optional `scope` (and `GridField` a `contextRecord` prop) so a future header-driven lock can bind `parent.*` — that wiring is deferred (it needs the master-detail header's re-renders isolated).
  - **Submit enforcement**: `requiredWhen` already drove react-hook-form's `required` rule, so submit is blocked with a field error when the predicate is TRUE and the value is empty. Added a reactive cleanup so a stale _required_ error clears when the predicate flips FALSE (and all errors clear when a field is hidden by `visibleWhen`).

- bd398df: Render reference/lookup cells as labels, not raw JSON

  A `lookup` / `master_detail` value can arrive as a JSON-encoded object string —
  e.g. an unresolved external-id reference `{"externalId":"Website Relaunch"}`.
  `LookupCellRenderer` treated the whole JSON string as an opaque id, failed to
  resolve it, and fell through to `String(value)`, leaking raw JSON into the grid
  cell (and detail/kanban surfaces).

  - `LookupCellRenderer` now parses a JSON-object-looking string value and renders
    a human label (`name` → `label` → `externalId` → `id`).
  - `coerceToSafeValue` (the shared safe-render helper used by 8 cell renderers)
    gains the same JSON-string parsing, and `externalId` is added to the
    reference-label precedence for plain object values and arrays.

  Verified in the browser (showcase task grid: Project column shows "Website
  Relaunch" instead of `{"externalId":"Website Relaunch"}`) and by unit tests.

- 514f426: fix(master-detail): reliable submit + stable e2e hooks

  Fixes the "click Create, nothing happens" report, surfaced by a new live browser
  e2e harness that drives the form with real input.

  - **MasterDetailForm `handleSave`** now triggers the button-less parent form's
    submit from a deferred macrotask and re-queries the live `<form>` inside it.
    Calling `requestSubmit()` synchronously inside the click handler (right after
    the `setSaving` state update) intermittently dropped the nested submit event,
    so react-hook-form's `onSubmit` never ran and the click appeared to do nothing
    — only the occasional click got through. Deferring makes it fire every time.
  - **Stable `data-testid`s** so automation/e2e can drive the widgets
    deterministically (Radix Select + react-hook-form cannot be driven by
    synthetic DOM events): `select-trigger-{field}` / `select-option-{value}`
    (SelectField), `lookup-trigger-{field}` (LookupField), `line-items-add`
    (GridField), `md-form-submit` / `md-form-cancel` (MasterDetailForm).

- bd8b054: fix(currency): resolve the tenant default currency across the long-tail renderers

  Phase 2b of the currency-resolution work (ADR-0053). The cell/field renderers
  already funnelled through `resolveFieldCurrency` + `useLocalization` (#1856),
  but the rest of the renderers still hard-coded `USD` or read only one of
  `currency`/`defaultCurrency`. They now share the same resolution chain — explicit
  field currency -> `currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` -> legacy `defaultCurrency` ->
  tenant `localization.currency` -> plain number:

  - `plugin-dashboard` `ObjectMetricWidget` (inferred currency), `ObjectDataTable`
    (symbol-format fallback).
  - `plugin-grid` `useColumnSummary` (footer agrees with the cells) and
    `ObjectGrid` (compact amount + name-inferred currency cells).
  - `plugin-detail` `DetailView` summary metrics.
  - `plugin-gantt` `ObjectGantt` currency tooltips.
  - `components` `element:number` (`format: 'currency'`) — tenant default instead
    of a baked-in `USD`, and renders with the tenant locale.

  `resolveFieldCurrency` now lives in `@object-ui/i18n` (co-located with
  `useLocalization`, which supplies the tenant default); `@object-ui/fields`
  re-exports it, so the existing import path is unchanged. No behavior change when
  no tenant currency is configured — a field that declares its own currency, or a
  deployment with no `localization.currency`, renders exactly as before.

- db8cd00: feat(app-shell): global settle signal (window.\_\_objectui) + region aria-busy (ADR-0054 Phase 3)

  Adds a single machine-readable "is the app idle?" predicate (ADR-0054 C5). The
  data layer wraps the adapter's `fetch` to count in-flight requests, mirrored onto
  `window.__objectui` with live `idle` / `pendingRequests` getters plus `whenIdle()`
  and `subscribe()`. New `useSettleSignal()` React hook and lower-level exports
  (`getPendingRequests`, `subscribeSettle`, `whenIdle`, `withSettleSignal`,
  `installSettleSignalGlobal`). The list view and record-picker results regions now
  set `aria-busy` while fetching and `data-state="loading|idle"` for region-level
  waiting. Lets an automated (AI) driver wait for settle instead of hardcoding
  timeouts.

## 5.2.0

### Patch Changes

- 6c3f018: `CurrencyCellRenderer` now reads the currency code from three locations
  in priority order: `field.currency` (legacy grid configs) →
  `field.defaultCurrency` (canonical top-level) →
  `field.currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` (nested shape emitted by
  `@objectstack/spec` `Field.currency({ currencyConfig: ... })`).

  Previously the renderer only checked the first two, so currency-type
  fields defined via the canonical spec helper rendered without their
  configured symbol. When none of the three is set, the cell still
  gracefully degrades to a plain formatted number — never silently
  assuming USD.

- d912a60: CRM polish — denser kanban cards, smarter currency, calmer dates.
  - **plugin-kanban card body**: drop the verbose `Label: value` two-column
    grid in favor of a single-column dense list (values only, with the
    field label preserved as a hover `title` for accessibility). Pipeline
    cards across Salesforce / HubSpot / Linear all do this because the
    value's own type carries its meaning, and the saved space lets the
    title breathe.
  - **fields/formatCurrency**: drop trailing `.00` when the value is a
    whole number (Salesforce convention: `$1,234.50` keeps cents,
    `$1,234` doesn't). Pipeline amounts like `500,000.00` now read as
    `500,000`.
  - **fields/formatDate** default branch: drop the year when it matches
    the current year — `7月21日` instead of `2026年7月21日`. Past- and
    future-year dates keep the year for disambiguation
    (`2025年11月23日`).
  - **fields/CurrencyCellRenderer**: removed the now-redundant
    `.replace(/[.,]00$/, '')` workaround that hid cents for `precision:0`
    fields; the formatter now handles whole-unit trimming natively.

- e919433: Stop silently assuming USD when a currency field has no `currency`
  configured. For non-USD orgs (e.g. a CNY-based CRM seeded without an
  explicit currency) the cells now render as plain locale-formatted
  numbers (`150,000.00`) instead of `$150,000.00` — which was the #1
  "why is my RMB showing as dollars?" bug.

  Behavior change is opt-in via omission: when `currency` /
  `defaultCurrency` is set on the field/column, formatting is unchanged.

  Fixed call sites:
  - `@object-ui/fields`: `formatCurrency`, `formatCompactCurrency`, and
    `CurrencyCellRenderer` no longer default-param `'USD'`.
  - `@object-ui/i18n`: `formatCurrency()` falls back to `formatNumber`
    semantics when `currency` is omitted.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid`: column-summary formatter (`Sum: 5,000,000`
    instead of `Sum: $5,000,000.00`).
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: header-highlight currency formatter.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`: `ObjectMetricWidget` inferred
    currency now resolves to `undefined` (not `'USD'`) for un-tagged
    fields, so `MetricWidget`'s `isCurrency` heuristic falls through
    to plain number formatting.

- d9c3bae: `RichTextField` now translates its inline hints (`Format: markdown`,
  `Rich text editor (basic)`, `Enter text...`) instead of hardcoding
  English. Adds `fields.richText.*` keys to the en / zh locale packs.

## 4.5.0

### Patch Changes

- d714e85: Lookup display-name resolution now falls back through a Salesforce-style chain
  when an `$expand`'d reference object lacks a top-level `name`/`label`/
  `display_name`/`title` field:
  1. Standard display fields (existing behaviour)
  2. `salutation first_name last_name` composite — handles person records that
     only carry first/last name parts
  3. `email` — last-resort identifier, beats the opaque id

  Applies to `LookupCellRenderer`, `PageHeader.subtitle` interpolation,
  `DetailView` page-mode `titleFormat`, and the shared `formatRecordTitle`
  utility. Concretely: a Contact reference with `first_name: Bob`, `last_name:
Lin` and no `name` field now renders as `Bob Lin` everywhere — instead of
  the email or [object Object] fallback.

### Patch Changes

- 63eb66d: fix(detail): expand lookup fields so subtitle + lookup cells show display names

  The record-page fetch in `RecordDetailView` (the page-mode path) now
  requests `$expand` for every lookup/master_detail field on the object,
  mirroring the behaviour the legacy `DetailView` already had. Combined
  with two small downstream fixes — `PageHeader` subtitle interpolation
  now extracts `name/label` from expanded reference objects instead of
  rendering `[object Object]`, and `LookupCellRenderer` now short-circuits
  to `pickRecordDisplayName` when the value is already a nested record —
  all `record:*` renderers and the page header subtitle (`Owned by
{account}`) now display the related record's name rather than the raw
  foreign-key id.

### Patch Changes

- 89ae109: Fix click navigation and required-FK form rendering
  - **plugin-grid**: ObjectGrid's `getSelectFields()` now always includes `id` in
    the SELECT projection. Previously, when a view configured `columns` without
    `id`, the SQL driver stripped it from results, and row-click handlers silently
    no-oped because `record.id` was undefined.
  - **plugin-form / fields**: Master-detail fields now render as a single-value
    lookup picker (`LookupField`) in create/edit forms instead of a one-to-many
    related-list widget. From the child-side, master-detail is the FK to the
    parent record and is typically NOT NULL — it must appear in forms. Prior
    behavior dropped it via the auto-layout exclusion list, which caused server
    errors like "NOT NULL constraint failed: contact.account" when users tried
    to create child records.

- 1b6dc64: fix: complete Tailwind v3→v4 migration cleanup
  - Rename deprecated `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0` and `flex-grow-N` →
    `grow-N` (Tailwind v4 dropped the long-form aliases). Affects
    data-table, fields/index, FileField, ChatbotEnhanced,
    FloatingChatbotPanel, ProcessDesigner, HistoryPanel, KanbanEnhanced,
    KanbanImpl, plugin-timeline index, FlowDesigner, LayoutRenderer.
  - Replace `theme(spacing.4)` inside arbitrary-value `[calc(...)]` with
    literal `1rem` in sidebar.tsx — `theme()` is deprecated in v4.
  - Remove obsolete v3-escape CSS overrides from index.css and
    sidebar-fixes.css. The component source now uses native v4 stacked
    data variants (`group-data-[state=collapsed]:group-data-[collapsible=icon]:w-(--sidebar-width-icon)`)
    which Tailwind v4 emits correctly without the manual overrides.
    Only the bespoke `.sidebar-menu-button-icon-mode*` rules are kept.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:
  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

## 3.4.0

### Patch Changes

- a2d7023: End-user feature batch — forms, designer history, import/export, and PWA offline sync.

  **Forms (`@object-ui/fields`, `@object-ui/providers`)**
  - `FileField`: native `<input capture="environment">` camera capture for mobile devices, plus a uploading-progress indicator driven by `UploadProvider`.
  - `ImageField`: per-image inline crop/rotate via the lazy-loaded `ImageCropperDialog` (canvas-based, zero new deps).
  - New `UploadProvider` in `@object-ui/providers` with pluggable adapters for S3 and Azure Blob (plus the default object-URL adapter for local previews). XHR-based with progress, abort, and retry.
  - `LookupField`: `lookup.dependsOn: string | string[]` to chain dependent lookups (e.g. State depends on Country); the trigger is gated until parent values are present and the OData `$filter` is built automatically.

  **Container-aware widget widths (`@object-ui/components`)**
  - New `useResizeObserver(ref)` hook exposing `{ width, height }` of any element. SSR-safe; reads the initial size via `getBoundingClientRect`.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-kanban` now react to their container size instead of `window.innerWidth`, so they behave correctly inside split panels and dashboards.

  **Designer history (`@object-ui/plugin-designer`)**
  - `useUndoRedo` (and therefore `useDesignerHistory`) gains `persistKey` + `storage` options to round-trip the undo/redo stack through `sessionStorage`, plus a `clearPersisted()` cleanup helper. Drafts now survive accidental tab refreshes.
  - New `<HistoryPanel>` component renders the timeline visually with one-click jump-to-checkpoint via the new `jumpTo(index)` API.

  **Import wizard (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**
  - Saved column-mapping templates: name, save, re-apply, and delete via a new template bar in the mapping step. Persisted under `objectui:import-templates:${objectName}` (override via `templateStorageKey` / `templateStorage`).
  - Inline validation correction: cells with errors in the preview step are now editable; corrections feed straight into the import without requiring a re-upload, with green-bar status indicators for fixed rows.

  **PWA offline sync (`@object-ui/mobile`)**
  - New `MemoryOfflineQueue` / `IndexedDbOfflineQueue` (`createOfflineQueue()` picks the best backend) backed by IndexedDB.
  - `createOfflineDataSource(inner, { queue })` wraps any DataSource so mutations issued while offline (or that fail with a network-style error) are queued and replayed in order on reconnect. Includes `replay()`, `drop()`, `clear()`, `pending()`, an `onChange` notifier, and an opt-in `resolveConflict` hook for stale-write conflicts.
  - New `useOfflineSync(source)` hook exposes `{ isOnline, pending, isReplaying, replay, drop, clear }` and auto-replays on the browser's `online` event.
  - `getServiceWorkerSource(opts)` emits a customisable Service Worker that pre-caches the app shell, applies network-first to API requests, and broadcasts `REPLAY_QUEUE` to clients on Background Sync. `requestBackgroundSync(tag)` registers a one-shot sync from the page.

- de881ef: Mobile UX round 3 — Form: sticky save bar, fullscreen long-text editor, and auto-stepper for long forms on small viewports.

  **`@object-ui/types`** — `ObjectFormSchema.mobile` (new) lets a single form opt into all three behaviours:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'object-form',
    objectName: 'leads',
    mode: 'create',
    mobile: {
      stickyActions: true,        // pin Submit/Cancel to bottom on phones
      stepper: 'auto',            // long forms render one field per step
      stepperMinFields: 8,        // …but only past this many fields
      stepperFieldsPerStep: 1,    // … (default 1)
      fullscreenLongText: true,   // textarea fields get an "expand" affordance
    },
  }
  ```

  `FormSchema.mobileStickyActions` (new) is the lower-level escape hatch — applied automatically when `mobile.stickyActions` is set on `ObjectFormSchema`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-form`** — `ObjectForm` now:
  - propagates `mobile.fullscreenLongText` to every textarea/markdown/html field as `mobile_fullscreen: true`,
  - sets `mobileStickyActions` on the inner form schema and adds `pb-20` padding so content isn't covered by the fixed bar,
  - when `mobile.stepper === true` (or `'auto'` + `useIsMobile()` + > `stepperMinFields` fields), routes the flat field list through the existing `WizardForm` with synthetic single-field "steps" — keeping per-step validation and the existing `Next`/`Back`/`Submit` flow.

  **`@object-ui/components`** — the registered `form` renderer adds:
  - a `mobileStickyActions` opt-in that turns the action row into a `position: sticky; bottom: 0` bar on small viewports, and
  - an inline `FullscreenTextarea` wrapper used when no field-package widget is registered, providing the same expand-button + edit-dialog UX so the feature works even in lighter setups.

  **`@object-ui/fields`** — `TextAreaField` ships the actual fullscreen UX: a top-right `Maximize2` button opens a near-fullscreen `Dialog` containing a full-height `Textarea` with a draft-then-commit save model (Cancel reverts).

  All three behaviours are off by default — existing forms render unchanged.
