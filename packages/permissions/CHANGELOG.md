### Minor Changes

- 2a40f69: Retire two post-retirement dead surfaces (#4364, #4368). Both were measured at this
  branch point rather than taken from their cards, and one card's premise only half held.

  Breaking for anyone who typed against the removed declaration, marked `minor` per this
  repository's version-alignment convention (the major tracks `@objectstack`, never an
  API-break count):

  - `@object-ui/types` and `@object-ui/permissions` no longer export
    `ObjectLevelPermission`. It declared a second, parallel home for object-scoped grants
    (`{ object, actions, effect?, conditions? }`) that nothing constructed, accepted or
    read once `RoleDefinition.permissions` was retired (#4288) — its only remaining
    referents were its own definition and the two barrel lines. The wired home is
    `ObjectPermissionConfig.roles`, whose inner grant shape is declared inline; that is
    what the evaluator reads, and it is unchanged. `ObjectPermissionConfig`'s doc comment
    now records the retirement so the surface is not re-declared. (#4364)

  `PermissionCondition` was proposed for retirement on the same card and is **kept**: its
  premise ("only referent is `ObjectLevelPermission.conditions`") did not hold at this
  branch point. `evaluateCondition` in `@object-ui/permissions` takes it as a parameter
  type and implements all eleven of its operators under a 26-case suite. `PermissionEffect`
  is likewise untouched — `FieldLevelPermission.effect` still reads it.

  No behaviour change, no public surface change:

  - `@object-ui/console` drops `src/utils/metadataConverters.ts` and
    `src/services/MetadataService.ts`. Both were console-local duplicates of live
    `@object-ui/app-shell` modules and lost their last importer when the bespoke
    object-detail widgets were retired (#4365). Both had already drifted behind the live
    copies they duplicate — the console converter's `referenceTo` chain never read the
    server's `reference` key, and the console service predates the view cache-invalidation
    seam (#4373) — which is precisely the imitation trap the card recorded: an author
    grepping for "the converter" could land on the unexercised copy. The app-shell copies
    and their tests are untouched. (#4368)

### Minor Changes

- 2307b52: fix(permissions,console): `MePermissionsProvider` retries a transient `/me/permissions` failure instead of stranding the app on its loading state

  "Not now" is a real answer from this endpoint. On a multi-tenant host it is served
  by the environment kernel that owns the session, and a COLD one answers `503` +
  `Retry-After` while it warms (objectstack#4159 / cloud#927). The provider treated
  that like any other failure: it set `error` — and a consumer that passes no
  `errorFallback` renders `loadingFallback` for the error state too. The console
  does exactly that (`loadingFallback={<LoadingScreen />}`, no `errorFallback`), so
  the app sat on its spinner indefinitely, with a `retry` nobody could reach.

  The fetch now re-attempts a **transient** failure — `408`, `425`, `429`, `502`,
  `503`, `504`, or a thrown fetch (offline / DNS / aborted), which never got an
  answer at all. A server-stated `Retry-After` wins over the exponential backoff
  (both wire forms are read, and clamped to 30s so a hostile value cannot park the
  UI); otherwise the delay doubles from `retryBaseDelayMs`. `loading` stays true
  across the waits, so the fail-closed loading state holds and consumers never see
  a permissive flash mid-recovery.

  Unchanged for a real answer about the caller: `401`, `403`, `404` and `500` fail
  on the first attempt exactly as before. `500` is deliberately not retried — a
  genuine server fault neither benefits from hammering nor should be hidden behind
  a spinner.

  **New props**, both optional and defaulted so no call site needs to change:

  - `maxRetries` (default `3`) — `0` restores the previous single-attempt
    behaviour.
  - `retryBaseDelayMs` (default `500`) — base for the exponential backoff.

  Also fixes a latent race the retries made much wider: the in-flight fetch is now
  cancelled when the effect tears down, so a slow answer for a previous `endpoint`
  or `fetcher` can no longer overwrite a fast answer for the current one. The retry
  primitives (`parseRetryAfterMs`, `backoffMs`, `isTransientFailure`,
  `TRANSIENT_STATUS`, `PermissionsFetchError`) live in a new internal `./retry`
  module — not exported from the package root.

  **The console now passes an `errorFallback`.** Retrying narrows the window but
  cannot close it — a kernel build slower than the retry budget still lands in the
  error state, and rendering `loadingFallback` there is what produced the eternal
  spinner. It now renders `<LoadingScreen error={...} onRetry={retry} />`, using the
  error + retry affordance that component has carried all along, so a user is never
  left with a spinner and no way forward.

### Patch Changes

- 49e5671: fix(console): `LocalizationFetchProvider` retries a transient `/me/localization` failure instead of degrading for the whole session

  `/auth/me/localization` is served by the environment kernel that owns the session
  on a multi-tenant host, and a cold one answers `503` + `Retry-After` while it
  warms (objectstack#4159). A transient failure is therefore a normal part of a
  cold start — not an exception.

  The provider made ONE attempt and `.catch()`-ed into silence. So a single 503
  during warm-up left currency and locale unset for the **whole session**, silently
  and permanently, long after the kernel was ready. Every money field rendered a
  plain number and nothing ever tried again.

  It now re-attempts a transient failure (`408`, `425`, `429`, `502`, `503`, `504`,
  or a thrown fetch), server-stated `Retry-After` first, exponential backoff
  otherwise. `401` / `403` / `404` / `500` are real answers about the caller and
  still fail on the first attempt.

  **It keeps its posture.** This provider is cosmetic, so it renders children
  throughout — including mid-retry — and fills the value in if and when an attempt
  succeeds. That is the opposite of `MePermissionsProvider`, which is fail-closed
  and holds its loading state across the waits. Both are pinned by tests.

  The retry PRIMITIVES ("is this transient", "how long to wait", `Retry-After`
  parsing) move from `@object-ui/permissions`'s internal module to
  `@object-ui/types` — the lowest package both callers can reach — and
  `PermissionsFetchError` becomes the generic `HttpFetchError`. One definition of
  transient, two policies, rather than a second copy free to drift from the first.
  No behaviour change for `MePermissionsProvider`.

## 17.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 2735de6: feat: render the server's effective API operation set (#3391 PR-4)

  The frontend now consumes the per-object **effective API operation set** the
  server resolves (from `/me/permissions` `apiOperations`, framework #3391) —
  never the raw `apiMethods` — so Import/Export/New/Edit/Delete buttons match what
  the server will actually admit, and a 405 import refusal shows a dedicated
  message instead of silently falling back.

  - **core** `resolveCrudAffordances(obj, effectiveApiOperations?)` — new optional
    second argument intersects each affordance bit with its API operation
    (create/import→create/import, edit→update, delete→delete, exportCsv→export).
    Omitting it (old backend / no effective set) leaves affordances unchanged.
  - **permissions** — `/me/permissions` response carries per-object
    `apiOperations`; `PermissionContextValue.getObjectApiOperations(object)`
    exposes it (undefined when absent → callers keep current behavior); `check()`
    maps `import→allowCreate`, `export→allowRead`.
  - **app-shell** `ObjectView` intersects its toolbar affordances with the object's
    effective operations (Import); the platform-admin identity-import bypass is
    unaffected.
  - **plugin-list** `ListView` / **plugin-grid** `ObjectGrid` gate the Export
    button (and export handler) on effective `export`; `plugin-grid` gains the
    `@object-ui/permissions` workspace dependency.
  - **plugin-grid** `ImportWizard` — a 405 / `OBJECT_API_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`
    import refusal is detected by a new `isImportNotAllowed` predicate at every
    catch site (async, sync, dry-run) and STOPS with a dedicated
    `grid.import.notAllowed` message (10 locales + fallback dict) — it never falls
    back to the sync/legacy path (which 405s too), distinct from the 404
    route-absent fallback.

  Backward-compatible: a missing effective set (unrestricted object, older
  backend, or no permission provider) preserves the current default-allow
  behavior everywhere.

### Patch Changes

- 53642d4: fix(core,fields): a string `$orderby` is a clause, not a character array — and localize the sharing-rule widgets (objectstack#3821)

  **The recipient picker listed nothing, ever.** `QueryParams['$orderby']` was
  typed as `Record | string[] | SortObject[]`, so `queryParamsToRecord` sent any
  non-array value through `Object.entries`. Handed the clause string `'name asc'`
  — which callers do build by hand — it walked the string index by index and
  emitted `$orderby=0 n,1 a,2 m,3 e,4 ,5 a,6 s,7 c`. The server sorted by columns
  that don't exist and every row was filtered out, so
  `sys_sharing_rule.recipient_id` rendered "No matches" for every recipient type
  and no sharing rule could be created from the Console. `ObjectGrid` builds the
  same shape from a schema-level `sort` in three places, so grids with a string
  sort silently showed an empty table.

  A string `$orderby` is now passed through verbatim (the server's OData
  normalizer has always parsed `'name asc'`), and the type admits `string`.
  `RecipientPickerField` additionally switched to the structured
  `{ name: 'asc' }` form so it can't regress this way against any data source.

  **The three sharing-rule authoring widgets never had translations.**
  `ObjectRefField`, `RecipientPickerField` and `FilterConditionField` hardcoded
  their English copy — a Chinese Console showed "Select an object", "Select a
  user", "Search…", "No matches", "Edit as JSON". They now go through
  `useFieldTranslation` like every other widget, with keys added under `fields.*`
  in all ten locales.

  The recipient placeholder was the interesting one: it read
  `` `Select a ${recipientType.replace(/_/g,' ')}` ``, interpolating the enum
  value into an English sentence — a shape no locale can translate. It is now a
  per-type key (`fields.recipient.selectUser`, `…selectBusinessUnit`, …), so
  "选择业务单元" and "Select a business unit" no longer have to share a structure.

  **Editing a rule silently dropped its recipient.** The picker resets the stored
  id when `recipient_type` changes, because an id valid for a user is meaningless
  for a team. It treated the edit form's `'' → 'user'` hydration as such a change:
  opening any saved rule blanked the recipient, and saving persisted the blank.
  Only a non-empty predecessor now counts as a type switch.

  **Building a filter submitted the surrounding form.** None of `FilterBuilder`'s
  controls declared `type="button"`, and a bare `<button>` inside a `<form>`
  defaults to `type="submit"`. Adding, removing or clearing a condition therefore
  submitted the sharing-rule dialog — firing validation mid-edit, and on an
  already-valid form saving the record before the admin was done.

  **A rejected write showed the user raw server diagnostics.** The form rendered
  `error.message` verbatim, so a sharing / RLS denial reached the dialog and the
  toast as `FORBIDDEN: insufficient privileges to update showcase_private_note
pi-TgoJ4_DM55Fqz` — untranslated, and leaking the object's machine name and the
  record id to whoever hit it. Permission failures now render localized copy
  (`form.noPermissionToSave`, added in all ten locales), with the server text kept
  on the console for debugging; other failures still show the server's message,
  which is the useful part, and fall back to `form.submitFailed` when there is
  none — replacing the previously hardcoded English "An error occurred during
  submission".

  **The detail header offered "Edit" on records the user may only read.** Object
  permissions can't express "this one record is read-only" — a read-only sharing
  grant sits inside an object the user may otherwise edit — so the header showed
  the primary Edit CTA, opened the form, and let the user retype a field before
  the server rejected the save. `DetailView` now gates Edit / Delete on the
  object-level check AND on the explain engine's record-grained verdict
  (`POST /api/v1/security/explain` with a `recordId`, ADR-0090 D6 / ADR-0095 C2 —
  the same pipeline the enforcement middleware runs, so button and server cannot
  disagree). Explaining oneself needs no special permission. The probe is one
  cached request per record, skipped entirely when the object-level check already
  says no, and **fails open** on every uncertainty — an unanswered hint must never
  be the reason a permitted user cannot act; the server stays the authority
  (ADR-0057 D10).

  **A long option rendered straight past the combobox border.** `Combobox`'s
  trigger pinned itself to the component's `w-[200px]` default while the fields
  around it ran the full form column, and the selected label was a bare text child
  of a flex button — flex items need `truncate` AND `min-w-0` to clip, and it had
  neither. So "成员 (showcase_project_membership)" in the object picker overflowed
  the control and collided with the field beside it. The label now truncates, the
  trigger can shrink, the dropdown matches the trigger's width instead of a
  hardcoded 200px (a widened combobox used to clip its own options), and the two
  sharing-rule pickers ask for `w-full` so they line up with every other input.

  Hardens `evaluatePermission` while there: a role config carrying only
  `fieldPermissions` (no `actions`) made `check()` throw a TypeError that
  propagated out of the render. A permission check must not be able to crash a
  view.

  Browser-verified against the framework showcase Console in Chinese: object /
  criteria / recipient copy is fully localized, the recipient dropdown lists real
  users, business units and positions, a saved rule reopens with its recipient and
  criteria intact, editing the filter no longer submits, and a rule created
  end-to-end stores a real record id rather than free text. The criteria authored
  in the builder is honored by the evaluator: `{"pinned":true}` on an owner-private
  object granted the recipient exactly the matching records and nothing else.

### Minor Changes

- 2b30583: fix(permissions): close the console FLS fail-open for token-only sessions (framework#2926 ④). Two halves: `MePermissionsProvider` gains a `fetcher` prop and the console passes `createAuthenticatedFetch()` so `/me/permissions` carries the Bearer token like every other data call (the cookie-only default fetch resolved token-only sessions as anonymous); and the unknown-object default is now authentication-gated — authenticated sessions fail CLOSED when an object has no resolved perms (fields render read-only instead of inviting input the data layer strips), while anonymous sessions keep the permissive default so guest/public forms keep working. Pairing note: with an older framework whose `/me/permissions` returns sparse objects for authenticated users, unconfigured objects now render read-only.

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
