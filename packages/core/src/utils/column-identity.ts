 * contract, and everything else is objectui-side legacy (AGENTS.md #0).
 *
 * Note this is the exact opposite of the FORM layer, where the runtime key is

/**
 * Stamp the canonical identity onto one column entry.
 *
 * The transitional strategy (objectui#3104 PR1) is **mirror, don't delete**:
 *
 *  - `field` is written with the resolved identity, so the request path — which
 *    reads `field` and ONLY `field` in `ListView`'s `$expand`/`$select`
 *    builders and in `ObjectGrid.getSelectFields` — always finds one.
 *  - a legacy key that is ALREADY PRESENT is overwritten with that same
 *    identity, so the name-first read sites still standing (`ListView` ×8,
 *    `ObjectGrid`, `ObjectTree`, the detail renderers) resolve to exactly what
 *    the request asked for.
 *  - a legacy key that is ABSENT is never invented. A spec-clean
 *    `{ field: 'stage' }` comes back untouched, by reference; the fold does not
 *    manufacture the legacy vocabulary it is trying to retire.
 *
 * This differs on purpose from `normalizeListViewSchema`'s other folds, which
 * DELETE the legacy key so a missed read-site fails loudly. Deleting works
 * inside this repo — every name-first read here falls through to `field` — but
 * `columns` entries cross the package boundary into host applications and
 * third-party renderers, and dropping `name` from under them is a breaking
 * change we have no inventory for. Mirroring is behaviour-preserving for every
 * reader, in or out of the repo; the deletion is PR3's call to make once the
 * in-repo consumers have converged onto {@link columnIdentity}.
 *
 * The result: for any single-key column the resolved identity is unchanged at
 * every read site. The only entries whose behaviour moves are the ones where
 * two sites already disagreed — which is the defect, not a regression.
