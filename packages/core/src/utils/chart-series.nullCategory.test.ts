/**
 * objectui#4466 — a NULL-keyed group must render as an explicit bucket, never
 * vanish.
 *
 * The single-dimension branch of `buildChartSeries` passed rows through
 * verbatim, so a row whose category VALUE is `null` reached recharts with a
 * null category and drew no mark. The sharpest measured case is the partial
 * one: `[{user_id: null, event_count: 51}, {user_id: 'Dev Admin',
 * event_count: 2}]` drew exactly ONE bar — the DOMINANT group (51 of 53
 * events) silently dropped, while the y-axis scale still accommodated it. The
 * chart was not merely empty, it understated its own data without saying so.
 *
 * This is the shipped first-boot state of the built-in System Overview board:
 * every seeded `sys_audit_log` row is written with `user_id = NULL`, so "Events
 * by User" groups to exactly one row and drew nothing at all.
 *
 * The division of labour with the framework#4033 guard is pinned here too,
 * because the fix could easily erase it: a row that does not carry the category
 * key AT ALL is NOT bucketed — that shape belongs to `hasNoCategoryKey`
 * (plugin-charts' `AdvancedChartImpl`), which explains itself instead of
 * drawing an empty axis. Key absent → that path; key present, value null →
 * this bucket.
 *
 * objectui#4497 extends the same doctrine to the MULTI-dimension pivot branch,
 * which #4466 deliberately left pinned as-is (that pin is updated below, in the
 * commit that changed it). The pivot's mechanism differs in exactly one way,
 * which is why it needed its own card: it buckets rows by a map KEY
 * (`String(xRaw ?? '')`) and writes a separate DISPLAY value into the emitted
 * row, so a null x was bucketed correctly and STILL reached recharts raw. The
 * key is untouched; only the display value is labelled. The drill half is
 * pinned at the bottom of this file, with the measurement behind it.
 *
 * objectui#4673 is the same defect one dimension over, and the last of the four:
 * the pivot's SECOND dimension kept the pre-#4466 answer (`gId !== ''`, drop
 * it) while still writing the dropped group's measure into the bucket. The
 * blocks at the bottom of this file are its own.
 *
 * objectui#4508 then answers what #4497 filed instead of widening into: that
 * map KEY was the DISPLAY string, so it could not tell a null group from an
 * empty-string one, nor from a record whose stored value spells the bucket
 * label. The key is now the bucket's IDENTITY (`chartBucketId`, the encoder the
 * pivot TABLE already uses), and where two distinct buckets still paint the
 * same axis text the emitted row carries that identity under
 * `CHART_BUCKET_ID_KEY` for the click to hand back. The three cases #4497
 * pinned as limits are updated at the bottom of this file, in the commit that
 * changed them — as that pin's own note said they would have to be.

/**
 * objectui#4682 — the click event carries the group's LABEL beside its key.
 *
 * `ChartSegmentClickEvent.series` is a `dataKey` {@link buildChartSeries}
 * assigned, and {@link findChartSeriesRow} resolves it back through that same
 * assignment. A consumer that TITLES itself from that key is reading an
 * internal id: for every ordinary group the key is the label, but the groups
 * whose label cannot name them key by identity, and the drawer then announced
 * `[null]` over a segment the user saw labelled `(None)`.
 *
 * `seriesLabel` is a second field rather than a change to the first, and this
 * block is why: the two strings answer different questions, and neither can do
 * the other's job. The label is not resolvable — it is precisely what the
 * colliding groups SHARE — and the key is not showable.
