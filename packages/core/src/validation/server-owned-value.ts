/**
 * The ONE client-side answer to "is this field's value the PRODUCER's to
 * supply?" — the other half of {@link isMissingForRequired}.
 *
 * A `required` verdict is a question about two facts: is the value absent
 * (`required-presence.ts`), and was the client ever supposed to provide it.
 * This module owns the second one. Both live here in `@object-ui/core` because
 * every layer that decides required-ness reads them: the form renderer
 * (`resolveFieldRuleState`), the wizard's cross-step gate, and the
 * create-form field builders in `@object-ui/plugin-form`.
 *
 * ## What makes a value server-owned
 *
 * A `defaultValue` may be a literal, or an *instruction* the server resolves
 * per insert:
 *
 *   - a runtime token — `'NOW()'` / `'current_user'`, the whole
 *     `DEFAULT_VALUE_TOKENS` family from `@objectstack/spec/data`
 *   - a CEL Expression envelope — `{ dialect: 'cel', source: 'today()' }`
 *
 * A CREATE form deliberately leaves such a control EMPTY and omits the key
 * from the payload, because `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults` resolves a declared
 * default only for a field that arrives absent or null (#4047 / #4068). The
 * field is therefore not "missing" on that submit — it is server-owned, and
 * nothing the client evaluates may declare it required (#4069 / #4085).
 *
 * ## Create only
 *
 * On an EDIT form the token was already resolved at insert. The control shows
 * a persisted value, so blanking it is a real removal and `required` (static
 * or conditional) enforces normally.
 */

/**
 * Is `v` a CEL/template Expression envelope rather than a literal value?

/**
 * Is this declared `defaultValue` a RUNTIME INSTRUCTION the server resolves per

 *
 * True for the `DEFAULT_VALUE_TOKENS` family (`'NOW()'` / `'current_user'`) and
 * for CEL/template Expression envelopes. This is THE classifier for "the
 * producer owns this field's create value", and every consumer reads THIS one
 * — a second copy would be free to disagree about, say, a CEL envelope, and
 * then a form would seed a field it also refuses to submit. Today's consumers:
 *
 *   1. seeding (#4047 / #4068) — such a default is not seeded, because putting
 *      the literal text `NOW()` into a datetime input and submitting it
 *      suppresses the very resolution the declaration asked for;
 *   2. the create-mode static `required` rule (#4069) —
 *      `isRequiredInForm` in `@object-ui/plugin-form`;
 *   3. the create-mode `requiredWhen` rule (#4085) —
 *      {@link isServerOwnedValue}, read by `resolveFieldRuleState`.

 * live" differently. It reads the runtime FormField's `field` slot — the
 * resolved object-field metadata the object-bound builders stash there
 * (`ObjectForm`, `sectionFields`, and the containers' no-sections paths), and
 * the only spelling of a declared `defaultValue` that reaches the renderer.
 * A hand-authored FormField carries no object metadata, so it is never
 * server-owned and its rules are untouched.
 *
 * `isCreateForm` is the CALLER's fact, never inferred here: the form renderer
 * reads it off `FormSchema.previousValues` (whose absence *is* the declared
 * "this is an insert" signal, objectui#3484), while the wizard's step gate
 * reads its own `mode`. An evaluator guessing from a `previous` argument would
 * call an edit-mode caller that simply passes no `previous` a create form, and
 * silently drop a `requiredWhen` the author meant to enforce.
