/**
 * `deleteView` removes every home the view has (#4479).
 *
 * A view has two possible homes — the pending per-item DRAFT
 * (`DELETE /meta/view/:name?state=draft`) and the PUBLISHED overlay
 * (`DELETE /meta/view/:name`) — and `deleteView` used to address only the
 * published one. The three cases, and what each used to do:
 *
 * | case               | before #4479                                        |
 * |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 * | draft-only view    | BUG — hits the published overlay, `reset:false`, the |
 * |                    | draft survives and the tab is back after reload      |
 * | published-only     | correct — `reset:true`, tab gone                     |
 * | published + draft  | ACCIDENTALLY correct — the published row goes, so    |
 * |                    | the tab goes; the orphan draft is left behind        |
 *
 * The third row is why the mirror of #4139 is NOT mechanical.
 * `persistRuntimeMetadata` (app-shell) stages **every** runtime edit as a
 * draft, so "publish a view, then edit it" routinely produces a pair — and a
 * naive draft-FIRST-only mirror would have discarded just the draft there,
 * silently downgrading **Delete view** into **Discard draft**, which is a
 * different operation that already exists (`discardRuntimeDraft`).
 *
 * The ruling on #4479: delete BOTH homes, draft first. Draft first because a
 * failure between the two calls then leaves the PUBLISHED overlay intact and
 * the operation cleanly retryable — the reverse order strands a draft-only
 * view, which is this card's original bug shape.
 *
 * ## The wire these pins model
 *
 * Every receipt below is the framework's own, read verbatim from
 * `packages/metadata-protocol/src/protocol.ts` (`deleteMetaItem`) — the
 * no-row branch and the delete-ful branch. Both no-row answers are a **200**
 * carrying `reset:false`, NOT a 404:
 *
 * - no draft pending  -> `{success:true, reset:false, message:"No pending draft for view/x."}`
 * - no published row  -> `{success:true, reset:false, message:"No view 'x' found — nothing to delete."}`
 *
 * That measurement is what makes a blind two-call implementation legitimate
 * here: neither "missing home" answer is an error, so there is nothing for a
 * probe to protect against and the probe `updateView` needs (its read must
 * resolve the row it is about to merge onto) has no counterpart for a delete.
 *
 * Nothing here mocks `deleteView`. The adapter is real and drives a
 * wire-shaped `fetch`; the SDK stand-in on `ds.client.meta.deleteItem`
 * mirrors the real client's transport (same URL, same `unwrapResponse`) so
 * that the pins address the REQUEST, not the transport that issued it.
