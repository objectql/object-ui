/**
 * `invalidateViewKeys` is the ONE place that knows the view cache key set
 * (objectui#4373).
 *
 * The behavioural half of this rule is already pinned next door, in
 * `viewCacheInvalidation.pin.test.ts`: eight cases assert the exact key list
 * every adapter write path emits. Those eight are deliberately unchanged by
 * #4373 — routing the four paths through a seam must change nothing they can
 * observe, and their staying green IS the refactor's acceptance evidence.
 *
 * But that is also their blind spot. A future edit that re-inlines
 * ``this.metadataCache.invalidate?.(`view-overrides:${objectName}`)`` back into
 * one write path emits the identical keys in the identical order, so every one
 * of those eight stays green while the seam quietly stops being the single
 * source of truth — and the next writer after that inherits a key list to
 * forget. That is not a hypothetical failure mode, it is the repo's measured
 * history: objectui#3778 removed five restated copies of a key no reader ever
 * populated, objectui#4363 fixed four restated copies that named half the live
 * set, and objectui#4373 is the third instalment — a writer OUTSIDE this class
 * (the console's create/publish flow through app-shell's ADR-0034 seam) that
 * never learned the key list at all.
 *
 * So the guard has to be structural, and the assertions below are on the SOURCE
 * TEXT of `index.ts`:
 *
 * | key template          | may appear exactly twice                        |
 * |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
 * | `` `view:${…}:${…}` ``     | the `getView` READ + the seam               |
 * | `` `view-overrides:${…}` ``| the `listViewOverrides` READ + the seam     |
 *
 * Two, not one: a reader must spell the key it caches under — that is where the
 * key is *defined*. What must not recur is a THIRD spelling, because the only
 * thing a third spelling can be is a writer restating what the seam already
 * knows. Re-inline any write path's key list and the count goes to three.
 *
 * If this goes red on a legitimate change: adding a new cached view-shaped READ
 * is the one case that raises a count honestly — pin the new reader here (and
 * teach {@link ObjectStackAdapter.invalidateViewKeys} to drop its key), rather
 * than relaxing the assertion to "at most N".
 */

/**
 * Read through `ts.sys`, not `node:fs` — the convention this package's
 * `cloud-surface-retired-4152.pin.test.ts` records and explains: `tsconfig.json`
 * compiles the whole test tree here, and keeping `@types/node` out of a
 * browser-side adapter's type environment is deliberate. TypeScript's own
 * system host is typed by the `typescript` devDependency.
