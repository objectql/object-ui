/**
 * `aggregate()`'s SPEC-SHAPE branch keeps `where` strict and refuses at the
 * producer (objectui#6825, maintainer ruling 2026-08-30 — option A).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `aggregate()` has two branches and they take a filter
 * by different names. The analytics branch takes `filter` and, since #6302,
 * lowers a rule-shaped array through `translateFilterArray` before posting it
 * to `/analytics/query`. The spec-shape branch takes `where` and posts it to
 * `POST /data/:object/query` VERBATIM — no lowering, before or after #6302. One
 * authored chart can reach either branch, and which one it reaches is decided
 * by whether it carries `groupBy`/`aggregations` — a property with nothing to
 * do with its filter.
 *
 * The card's census found a STRUCTURAL zero in this repo: no producer, fixture
 * or test can reach the spec-shape branch with a rule-shaped `where`
 * (`ObjectChart`'s gate needs a non-array `aggregate.groupBy`, and all three
 * in-tree constructors pass a string). So this is not about a failure RATE. It
 * is about the failure MODE, and about the half the census could not measure:
 * `ObjectChart`'s props are `any`, so an out-of-repo host may already send this
 * shape.
 *
 * What the old behaviour did with it: nothing visible. The array went to the
 * wire, the receiving engine refused it ("is not a filter" — objectstack's
 * `engine-filter-array-lowering.test.ts` pins `engine.aggregate` rejecting the
 * same shape with `400 INVALID_FILTER`, refused before the store is touched),
 * and where the predicate was instead dropped the chart rendered confident,
 * wrong numbers with no signal to their author. Neither end is a degradation;
 * both are failures. The ruling moves the refusal to the producer, where an
 * author can read it and act on it.
 *
 * ⛔ Three things this deliberately does NOT do, each a refused option:
 *   - it does not LOWER on the spec-shape branch (option B — the tolerant-
 *     consumer direction, and it would bless a shape `AggregateParams` does not
 *     declare);
 *   - it does not RETIRE the branch (option D — no in-repo producer, but the
 *     `props: any` half is unmeasurable);
 *   - it does not touch `AggregateParams` (`packages/types`), which is carded
 *     separately.
 *
 * ⭐ WHICH BRANCH RAN IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. The two branches post to
 * different endpoints, so the wire proves the branch for anything that reaches
 * it. A refusal reaches nothing, so for the refusing inputs the branch is
 * proven a second way: `looksLikeSpecShape` is transcribed into
 * `branchSelectors()` below and the refused params are asserted to produce the
 * SAME selector triple as a control that is observed on the spec-shape wire.
 * Without that, a test that accidentally landed in the analytics branch would
 * pass for the wrong reason.
