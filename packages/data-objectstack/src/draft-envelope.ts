/**
 * Take the body out of a served draft envelope (`{ type, name, item }`) and
 * remove the framework's own READ DECORATIONS from it — or answer `null` when
 * there is nothing pending.
 *
 * ## Why this function exists at all (objectui#8181)
 *
 * It was implemented three separate times — once in `ResourceEditPage`, once in
 * `StudioDesignSurface`, once in `PackageOwdOverviewPanel` — plus a fourth
 * hand-rolled copy in `ObjectHooksPanel` under a different name. objectui#7603
 * taught exactly ONE of those copies to strip. That is the defect this file
 * closes, and it is a different defect from "N consumers forgot": four
 * byte-identical copies of a rule mean the next copy is free to omit it again,
 * so the cure is one function rather than four strips.
 *
 * ## Why it lives HERE and not in `app-shell`
 *
 * Next to the {@link MetadataClient.getDraft} that produces the envelope this
 * decodes. `getDraft` deliberately hands back the wire envelope rather than the
 * body (objectui#4271), so the unwrap is part of that method's contract, not a
 * detail of any one view. `app-shell` already depends on this package, and the
 * one non-app-shell consumer (`updateView`, in this package) is a caller too.
 *
 * ## The verdict runs BEFORE the strip, never after
 *
 * What counts as a pending draft is `getDraft`'s answer. A draft whose only
 * keys are decorations is still a served draft, so the emptiness verdict is
 * taken on the body as it arrived; the strip may return an EMPTY object, but it
 * may never turn a served draft into "no draft". Pinned in
 * `draft-envelope.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Which keys, and which keys deliberately survive
 *
 * The list is the SPEC'S (`METADATA_READ_DECORATIONS`), reached through its own
 * exported helper — the same one `MetadataService.saveFields` uses on the write
 * side. Never a second hand-maintained `['_diagnostics', '_draft']` in this
 * repo: a local copy goes stale the next time the framework adds a decoration,
 * and a decoration this code does not know to remove is precisely the defect.
 *
 * The ADR-0010 protection envelope (`_lock`, `_provenance`, `_packageId`,
 * `_packageVersion`, ...) shares the underscore spelling and is deliberately
 * NOT on that list: those keys are declared by the closed schemas so provenance
 * survives a re-parse. This strip leaves them alone, and doing otherwise would
 * be the same "drop whatever looks internal" pass AGENTS.md #0.1 bans.
 *
 * ## Not a lenient fallback
 *
 * It removes exactly the two keys the framework ADDS AT READ TIME and never
 * stores. A genuinely unrecognized key still fails loudly at whichever gate
 * sees it next.
 *
 * @param resp the value `MetadataClient.getDraft()` resolved to.
 * @returns the decoration-free draft body, or `null` for "nothing pending".
