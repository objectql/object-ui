/**
 * `createObjectStackAdapter`'s declared return is the adapter, not the shared
 * `DataSource` interface (#7323).
 *
 * The factory declared `DataSource<T>` while returning `new ObjectStackAdapter`.
 * A wider value is assignable to a narrower annotation, so nothing failed to
 * compile — the loss was entirely on the reading side: every adapter-only
 * member was erased from the type the factory handed back, while staying on the
 * object it handed back. Measured on the shipped `dist/index.d.ts` before the
 * fix, nine reads through `ReturnType<typeof createObjectStackAdapter>` failed
 * with TS2339: `getClient`, `getCacheStats`, `invalidateCache`, `clearCache`,
 * `getConnectionState`, `isConnected`, `onConnectionStateChange`,
 * `onBatchProgress`, `setSystemCapabilities`. Eight of those are exactly the
 * members the package README's API Reference documents, and the ninth is the
 * one the factory's own JSDoc links to.
 *
 * ## Where these pins get their colour
 *
 * Most of this file is COMPILE-time, which is the only place this defect is
 * observable: the values were always there, so every runtime test passed
 * against the narrow declaration too. `vitest` transpiles with esbuild and
 * erases types, so the colour comes from
 * `pnpm --filter @object-ui/data-objectstack type-check` — this package's
 * `tsconfig.json` includes its whole `src/**` (tests included), the same
 * property `deleteViewContract.types.test.ts` documents and relies on.
 *
 * ## The controls
 *
 * Two, and they answer different questions.
 *
 *   1. `_NotOnDataSource` — the adapter-only members are ABSENT from the shared
 *      `DataSource` interface. This is what makes the reads below a statement
 *      about the FACTORY's return rather than a statement about every data
 *      source. It also fires on option B of the card (moving caching,
 *      connection state and batch progress onto `DataSource` so every
 *      implementation has to declare them) — the shape #7323 argues against.
 *   2. `_StillADataSource` — the widened return is still assignable to
 *      `DataSource`. The triage's open question was whether the narrow return
 *      was a deliberate swappability guarantee; this states that widening did
 *      not cost it, so a caller who wants the narrow surface still just writes
 *      `const ds: DataSource = createObjectStackAdapter(…)`.
 *
 * Both controls are independent of the return annotation, so a revert of the
 * source change turns the reads below red and leaves these two green.
