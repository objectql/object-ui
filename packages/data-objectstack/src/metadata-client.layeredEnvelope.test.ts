/**
 * `MetadataClient.layered()` validates the ADR-0010 protection envelope at the
 * boundary (objectui#5676).
 *
 * ## The defect, measured rather than argued
 *
 * The envelope used to arrive by ten `as` assertions over a raw `res.json()`
 * body — no parse, no allowlist, no default. The banner that consumes it opens
 * on `layered?.lock && layered.lock !== 'none'`, which is true for ANY non-`none`
 * value, so a server sending a lock state this console had never heard of opened
 * the amber box, drew the padlock and the border, and rendered an empty title.
 * No fifth state ever had to be added to this repo for that to happen — which is
 * why objectui#5024's duplicated-union framing could not have caught it. A union
 * types what this repo WRITES and constrains nothing about what a server SENDS.
 *
 * ## What is pinned here, and what is deliberately pinned elsewhere
 *
 * The ruling is "pass through and label", extending to the whole envelope the
 * treatment objectui#5672 chose for `lock` alone. That splits across two files
 * and neither half is sufficient on its own:
 *
 *   - THIS file pins the boundary: recognised values arrive typed from the
 *     producer's own schema, unrecognised ones are still FORWARDED (never
 *     dropped, never thrown) and are named in `_unrecognized`.
 *   - `ResourceEditPage.lockBanner.test.tsx` pins the screen: a token the banner
 *     cannot read is titled with the raw token instead of rendering blank.
 *
 * The forwarding assertions below are exactly the precondition that file's
 * fixtures assume. Together they are the ruled "an unknown `lock` token still
 * reaches the banner labelled"; separately, each is green against a client that
 * fails the other half.
 *
 * ## Why `safeParse` and not `parse`
 *
 * A bare `.parse()` was refused by name on the filing card: it turns a
 * silently-wrong render into a thrown or rejected response, which is a behaviour
 * change for every consumer of this client rather than a tightening of types. A
 * metadata console that rejected every dialect it had not been compiled against
 * would answer a newer server with a blank page — strictly worse than the wrong
 * render being fixed. The counter-probe at the bottom of this file is what keeps
 * that option refused: it is green only while structurally malformed bodies
 * RESOLVE, so an implementation that throws on anything it does not recognise
 * cannot pass this suite even though it would satisfy every other assertion.
