/**
 * The SECOND client class's metadata save door must surface the runtime
 * authoring gate's advisory findings (objectui#4237; backend objectstack#7435).
 *
 * `ObjectStackClient.meta.saveItem` writes through the same
 * `PUT /api/v1/meta/:type/:name` as `MetadataClient.save`, but it is a
 * different class and #4133/#4236 only covered the other one — every caller
 * here awaited the call and discarded the response, so an `advisories[]` the
 * server attached was parsed off the wire and dropped. These pins are the
 * red-first evidence: with `installSaveAdvisoryInterceptor()` reverted, every
 * "emits" case below fails because no event is ever produced.
 *
 * ## Why these drive a REAL SDK client through a fake `fetch`
 *
 * The sibling `onWriteWarning.test.ts` replaces `ds.client` with a stub, which
 * is right for the data door. It would be wrong here: the whole premise of this
 * fix is a measurement about the wire — that the SDK's `unwrapResponse` hands
 * the save body back VERBATIM (it strips its `{ success, data }` envelope only
 * when the body has a `data` key, and this one does not), so `advisories` is
 * still at the top level where the shared `readSaveAdvisories` looks for it.
 * Stubbing `meta` would assume exactly the thing under test. Driving the real
 * client keeps that measured on every run.
