/**
 * objectui#4016 — `MetadataClient.layered()` reads the three-layer projection
 * from the path the framework DECLARES for it, `GET /meta/:type/:name/layers`,
 * instead of flagging the ordinary item read.
 *
 * Why the move (objectstack#5882, ruled B by the maintainer; server half landed
 * in objectstack#6596): one route was answering two unrelated representations
 * chosen by a query flag, while `packages/spec` declared only the unflagged one.
 * Anything generating a client from the route table — SDK annotations, codegen,
 * an AI-written integration — produced a parser that was simply wrong for the
 * flagged call. The projection now has a path of its own AND a response schema
 * of its own (`GetMetaItemLayeredResponseSchema`); the flag still answers the
 * same body during a deprecation window, marked with RFC 9745 `Deprecation` and
 * an RFC 8288 `Link: rel="successor-version"`, and is scheduled for removal.
 *
 * `@objectstack/client` is not in the picture on purpose: the SDK expresses no
 * layered read in either spelling (the framework's REST route ledger records
 * this route as `server-only`, "consumed by objectui over plain HTTP"), so this
 * package builds the request and these cases are what hold it to the contract.
 *
 * The path expectation is DERIVED from the installed `@objectstack/spec` route
 * table rather than retyped here — a hand-copied string would keep passing
 * after the producer moved the route, which is the failure mode this whole card
 * exists to remove.
 *
 * The repo-wide half — that no shipped source file or skills guide reaches the
 * projection by query flag any more — is a ratchet over a scan surface wider
 * than this package, so it lives in
 * `scripts/__tests__/layered-read-declared-path-4016.test.ts`.
