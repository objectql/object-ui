/**
 * `app-schema-renderer.mobileNavMode` is a published VOCABULARY, not free text
 * (objectui#3985, maintainer ruling 2026-08-10).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The registration declared `{ name: 'mobileNavMode', type: 'string' }` while
 * the renderer implemented a small closed set. `checkType`'s string arm asks
 * only `typeof value === 'string'`, so `mobileNavMode="bottom-nav"` — the
 * hyphenated spelling of the underscored value, the single most likely typo on
 * this key — passed the manifest gate, passed the parser, reached the renderer,
 * missed its one equality test, and rendered the default. No diagnostic at any
 * layer. The designer drew a free-text box rather than a picker for the same
 * reason. That is objectui#3972's family with the polarity flipped: the
 * declaration was WIDER than the implementation, so the `invalid-enum` that
 * should have fired never could.
 *
 * The union also carried a third member with a JSDoc line promising "collapsed
 * sidebar" behaviour and zero read points, i.e. a value whose entire effect was
 * to be indistinguishable from the default. It is retired here under ADR-0049
 * enforce-or-remove; the ruling is explicit that making it behaviour is an
 * implementation card first.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and where each pin actually fires
 *
 *   1. THE DECLARATION — an `enum` over exactly the implemented values. Fails
 *      in this run if the declaration is widened back to `string`, or if a
 *      value with no read point is added to the published vocabulary.
 *   2. THE VERDICT, through the real validator — `manifestFromConfigs` over the
 *      LIVE registration plus `compile`, never a hand-written manifest that
 *      could agree with itself. A misspelling and the retired value both come
 *      back `invalid-enum` at severity `error`; both legal values come back
 *      clean, which is the control that stops "no diagnostics" from passing for
 *      an empty reason.
 *   3. THE TYPE — a `@ts-expect-error` on the retired literal. This one does
 *      NOT fire in the Vitest run: Vitest transpiles without type-checking, so
 *      re-widening `MobileNavMode` leaves this file green here and fails
 *      `pnpm --filter @object-ui/layout type-check` instead ("Unused
 *      '@ts-expect-error' directive"). Said out loud because a pin whose gate
 *      you cannot name is a pin nobody will re-run.
 *
 * Behaviour of the two surviving values is pinned where behaviour belongs, on
 * the rendered DOM, in `AppSchemaRenderer.test.tsx` — a declaration test that
 * also claimed to prove rendering would be proving it from the wrong face.
