### Patch Changes

- 82441e4: feat(console-ai): proactive AI usage indicator in the ChatDock (ADR-0057 #8)

  Surfaces remaining AI headroom **before** a send hits the 429 wall, instead of
  only learning the limit reactively.

  - **AiUsageIndicator** — two meters (build + dataChat) as small progress rings in
    the ChatDock header (desktop rail + mobile sheet). Near-full → an amber
    "running low" hint and a popover with "resets tonight / next cycle" plus the
    upgrade / top-up CTA (reusing the 429 deep-link). D5-safe: fractions and
    qualitative words only, never a token number. Hides itself when the usage
    endpoint is absent (older backend / OSS / no seat).
  - **useAiUsage** — fetches the D5-safe per-meter fractions; refetches on the chat
    engine's post-turn / 429 nudge and on tab re-focus; fails soft to nothing.
  - **useObjectChat** emits `AI_USAGE_REFRESH_EVENT` on a rejected send (429) and on
    the turn-finish edge so the ring updates right after the user's action.
  - i18n: `console.ai.usage.*` in en + zh-CN.

  Consumes the cloud `GET /api/v1/ai/usage` endpoint (objectstack-ai/cloud#824).

- 2efa9fd: Detail-page UX follow-ups from the ADR-0085 PR4 real-backend browser pass (framework#2548):

  - **Highlight strip no longer repeats the record title.** A declared
    `highlightFields` list containing the title field rendered it as the first
    chip — truncated — directly under the identical page H1. `deriveHighlightFields`
    now resolves the title (`primaryField` / `nameField` / deprecated
    `displayNameField`, else the conventional display-field names) via the new
    exported `resolveTitleField` and filters it from declared lists before the
    4-chip cap, matching what the heuristic branch always did. app-shell's
    `RecordDetailView` synthParts (which pre-computes the list and bypasses the
    derivation) applies the same filter.
  - **Per-field currency reaches the renderers.** The spec channel
    (`currencyConfig.defaultCurrency`) was dropped by the highlight-strip and
    detail-section field enrichment, so a spec-authored currency field could
    never show its symbol ("25,000,000" instead of "$25,000,000");
    `resolveFieldCurrency` reads it second after the designer-only bare
    `currency` key.
  - **app-shell approvals fetches send the Bearer token.** The header badge
    poll, home-inbox count, and record-page approvals panel were cookie-only
    (new shared `bearerAuthHeaders()` util) — same split-origin failure mode as
    the console `approvalsApi` fix below.
  - **`fieldGroups[].icon` / `description` reach detail pages.** The shared
    derivation (ADR-0085 §5) already passed them through; the detail synth
    dropped them. Sections now carry both, and `DetailSection` renders a real
    Lucide icon for identifier-shaped names (emoji/text values keep the
    historical text rendering).
  - **Record meta footer stops dangling without an actor.** Seeded/system rows
    with `created_by: null` rendered "Created by · 10m ago"; the footer now
    falls back to actor-less labels ("Created / Updated"), with new i18n keys in
    all six locales (and the zh `createdBy`/`updatedBy` mistranslation fixed:
    创建人/更新人, not 创建于/更新于).
  - **Select badges ellipsize instead of clipping mid-glyph.** In bounded
    containers (highlight-strip columns, grid cells) an overlong option label
    used to be cut at the container edge ("Technolog…"); badges now shrink with
    an inner truncate and expose the full label as a hover title. The highlight
    strip's hover title also prefers the option label over the raw stored value.

  Console app (unversioned): `approvalsApi` now sends the stored Bearer token
  like every other console call — cookie-only auth silently lost the approvals
  surface on split-origin deployments where the SameSite cookie doesn't flow.

- e628d1f: Dashboard-level filters follow-ups (#2578, framework#2501):

  - **i18n**: the `DashboardFilterBar` strings now ship as real locale entries —
    `dashboard.filters.*` (bar label, "All time", "Custom…", "All", "Reset",
    and the 13 date-range preset labels) added to `en` and `zh`. Previously the
    bar always rendered the `useSafeTranslate` English fallbacks.
  - **types**: `GlobalFilterSchema.name` and `DashboardWidgetSchema.filterBindings`
    landed in `@objectstack/spec` (framework#2501), so the local type
    annotations flip from "Pending alignment" to "Aligned" — no shape changes.

  Also adds five schema-catalog examples (`plugin-dashboard/filtered-dashboard-*`:
  dynamic `optionsFrom` options, text/number/lookup filter types, dataset +
  inline widget mix, `targetWidgets` allow-list, date presets + custom range)
  and a new "Dashboard-Level Filters" guide page covering the full tutorial,
  `page.*` expression usage, and known limitations with workarounds.

- 23d65c3: fix(i18n): `createSafeTranslation` / `useSafeTranslate` no longer wrap the
  translation hook in try/catch — the last known rules-of-hooks violation of
  the class fixed in objectui#2595/#2596 (a throw after the hook ran would
  desync hook order on the next render; the factory closure just escaped the
  static lint). `useObjectTranslation` is provider-safe, and the actual
  fallback behavior is unchanged: the testKey probe (createSafeTranslation)
  and per-key `t(key) === key` detection (useSafeTranslate) still return the
  English defaults when translations aren't configured. The fallback `t` is
  now a stable per-factory reference, so downstream memo deps stop
  invalidating every render in the no-translations case.

### Patch Changes

- c70bca7: fix(console-ai): Live Canvas is a full-screen, opt-in preview on mobile — not a broken split (#2481)

  On a phone the beside-chat Live Canvas split overflowed the viewport (the chat
  column's fixed min-width plus the preview exceeded the screen, and the resize
  handle is desktop-only, so it was stuck clipped). Under `md` the canvas is now:

  - **Full-width chat, no split** — the build streams in the chat as before.
  - **Opt-in + full-screen** — when the preview is available a floating "Preview
    app" pill appears; tapping it (or a Preview button on a draft card) takes the
    canvas full-screen over the chat. Closing returns to the chat with the
    preview one tap away. The auto-drafted canvas never covers the streaming
    chat unprompted.

  Desktop is unchanged (the resizable beside-chat split). Adds the
  `console.ai.previewApp` string (en/zh).

- 05e56ca: 导出/导入模板的下载文件名与内容本地化。

  **导出文件名**:CSV/Excel/JSON 导出下载不再是 `<对象名>.<扩展名>`(如 `contracts.csv`),改为「对象显示名-视图名-时间戳.扩展名」(如 `任务-In Progress-20260714-153045.xlsx`);`exportOptions.fileNamePrefix` 配置仍优先(且作为完整前缀,不再追加视图名)。视图名与对象名重复时自动省略;`@object-ui/core` 新增 `buildExportFileName(ext, { prefix, label, objectName, viewLabel }, now?)` 与 `sanitizeFileNameBase(raw)`,ObjectGrid 与 ListView 的所有导出路径(服务端流式与前端兜底)统一走它。app-shell/plugin-view 的 ObjectView 现将当前视图的显示标签写进传给 ListView 的 schema(`label`),使导出文件名能区分同一对象的不同保存视图。

  **导入模板**:「下载模板」修复两处英文漏出——示例行的 select/多选取值改为优先取选项**显示标签**(如 `准备中`)而非 ASCII slug(`prepare`,服务端导入两者都接受);模板文件名本地化为 `{{object}}-导入模板.csv`(新增 i18n key `grid.import.templateFileName`,英文回退 `{{object}}-import-template.csv`)。

- 5971cc4: i18n: translate the Profile page, honor inline i18n label objects under bare
  base-language codes, and localize managed-by badges / record quick actions.

  - `pickLocalized` now upgrades a bare base language (`zh`) to any
    region-qualified key sharing the base (`zh-CN`) — runtime language is
    normalized to the base code while metadata authors write full BCP-47 tags,
    so inline `{ en, 'zh-CN', ... }` label objects previously fell back to
    English.
  - ProfilePage (`account:profile_card` / `/system/profile`): every hardcoded
    string — page title/subtitle, avatar Upload/Replace/Remove, Personal
    Information card, Change/Set Password card — now goes through
    `useObjectTranslation()` with `profile.*` keys (new namespace in all ten
    locale bundles); the lazy-load fallback reuses `common.loading`.
  - `ManagedByBadge` chips/tooltips (Config/System/Append-only/Identity) now
    resolve through new `managedByBadge.*` keys with `{{provider}}`
    interpolation.
  - `record:quick_actions` resolves action labels via the
    `objects.{object}._actions.{action}.label` convention plus `pickLocalized`,
    so object action buttons (Change Password, Enable 2FA, …) localize.
  - `record:details` / `record:related_list` / `record:alert` / `ObjectTree`
    pass inline label objects through `pickLocalized`.
  - Locale bundles: added `managedByBadge` namespace to all ten locales and
    backfilled `list.inlineEditShort` / `inlineEditLabel` /
    `recordEditingTitle` for ja/es/ko/de/fr/pt/ru/ar.

## 13.2.0

### Patch Changes

- 53c40c2: feat: identity import — the stock ImportWizard now drives sys_user bulk import (framework#2782)

  The Users list gets an Import entry for platform admins (gated on
  `features.admin` from `/api/v1/auth/config` plus workspace-admin), wired to
  the dedicated `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/import-users` pipeline instead of the
  generic data import (which would bypass better-auth hashing and produce
  accounts that can never sign in).

  - **plugin-grid**: two generic, backend-agnostic ImportWizard slots —
    `extraOptionsContent` (host-injected options on the preview step) and
    `renderResultExtra` (host-rendered content on the result step).
  - **app-shell**: identity import dataSource adapter — splits files into the
    endpoint's ≤500-row batches (idempotent upsert makes re-runs safe), injects
    the selected password policy, renumbers per-batch results onto the whole
    file, and enriches rows with their sign-in identity. Password policy panel
    (`none` default / `invite` / `temporary`) and a one-shot temporary-password
    reveal with CSV download (client memory only — nothing is persisted).
    Async-job/undo surfaces are hidden for identity import by design.
  - **auth**: `AuthPublicConfig.features.admin` typing.
  - **i18n**: en/zh strings for the identity import panels.

### Minor Changes

- 9e38270: feat(setup): "Connect an agent" page widget (`mcp:connect-agent`) — framework#2714 Phase 1, #2363

  The interactive body for the plugin-carried Setup page shipped by
  `@objectstack/mcp`: the environment's MCP URL (from `/discovery`), per-client
  connect cards (claude.ai/Desktop, Claude Code incl. the official plugin,
  Cursor one-click deeplink, VS Code, Codex CLI), the SKILL.md download
  (`GET /api/v1/mcp/skill`), and show-once API-key minting for headless
  callers via the existing `POST /api/v1/keys`. Renders a disabled empty state
  when discovery doesn't advertise `routes.mcp` (deployment opted out).
  Translations for all nine locales.

## 12.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e1840bf: Signal the platform's preview stage in the UI.

  The console top bar (`AppHeader`) now shows a small **Preview** chip next to the
  product wordmark on every surface (home / app / orgs), so users always know the
  whole platform is pre-GA. It's a new `PreviewBadge` component driven by a
  `branding.stage` field in runtime-config (`'preview' | 'beta' | 'ga'`, exposed
  via `getPlatformStage()`), which defaults to `'preview'` so the badge shows out
  of the box. Operators flip the stage to `'ga'` at launch (`OS_PRODUCT_STAGE` /
  `RuntimeConfigPlugin`) and the badge disappears with no code change; `'beta'`
  renders a "Beta" chip instead. Labels are localized under `topbar.stage.*`.

### Patch Changes

- 6cbccf3: Localize form validation messages, toast client-side validation failures, and make native date/time picker icons legible in dark mode.

  Record-form validation messages (required, min/max length, min/max value, pattern, email, URL) were hard-coded English even when the field label was localized — e.g. a Chinese "计划开始日期" field showed "计划开始日期 is required". `buildValidationRules` baked English strings, so the form renderer's `t(...)` fallback never applied. It now emits `required: true` and, for the other rules, a `messageKey` + `undefined` message (a field-authored `*_message` still wins and passes through verbatim); the form renderer fills the blanks via i18n (`validation.*` keys already exist in every locale), so messages track the label's language.

  When client-side validation blocks a submit, the offending field's inline error can sit below the fold in a long modal/drawer form — the user clicks 创建 and sees nothing happen. The form renderer now also fires a `toast.error` naming the fields (`validation.formInvalid`, added to all 10 locales), mirroring the existing server-error toast so the feedback is visible regardless of scroll position.

  Separately, native controls now declare `color-scheme` (`light` on `:root`, `dark` on `.dark`), so the webkit calendar-picker-indicator and other built-in glyphs render light-on-dark instead of vanishing against the dark input background.

## 12.0.0

## 11.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 544d8eb: Add the app → Studio reverse bridge (ADR-0080): workspace admins see a "Design in Studio" entry in the app top bar that deep-links to the running app's owning package on the Studio design surface (`/studio/:packageId/data`). Hidden for non-admins and for apps with no owning package; package writability stays server-side (read-only packages open as browse-only).
- 1072701: Import wizard: use registered server-side import mappings (framework #2611). When an object has `mapping` metadata artifacts targeting it, the wizard shows a "Saved mapping" selector; picking one hands rename + transforms + write semantics to the server (the artifact is authoritative), replaces the manual column table with a read-only summary of the mapping, and submits `mappingName` over source-header rows (mutually exclusive with the inline column rename). `ImportRequestOptions` gains `mappingName`; the objectstack adapter gains `listImportMappings(objectName)` (feature-detected — the selector simply doesn't appear when unsupported). New `grid.import.*` strings added across all locales.

## 11.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 9cd9be1: fix(plugin-grid): make the import wizard's preview step readable — wider columns + friendlier validation errors

  Two problems on the import wizard's 预览 (preview) step:

  - **Cramped preview table.** With many mapped columns crammed into the fixed
    dialog width, each header collapsed to one character per line (`关联排班计划`
    stacked vertically) and became unreadable. Columns now get a `min-width` and
    headers no longer wrap, so the preview area scrolls horizontally instead of
    crushing every column.

  - **Unreadable dry-run error messages.** A reference cell that couldn't resolve
    rendered as `第 1 行: product: product: no os_tianshun_ehr_product matches "导管架"`
    — the field named twice, an internal object api-name leaking through, all in
    English. The server already tags each failure with a structured `code`, so we
    now drive the message off that code (localized, with the offending value),
    resolve the field's api-name to its label, and only fall back to the raw
    server text — minus the duplicated prefix — for unrecognized codes. The same
    row now reads `第 1 行: 产品：找不到匹配 "导管架" 的记录`.

- 790558b: fix(studio): make the Automations and Interfaces pillars authorable in a fresh package

  Dogfooding a brand-new package end-to-end (design objects → automations →
  interfaces → publish → use) surfaced two blocking dead-ends in the pillar
  Studio, both now fixed:

  - **Automations pillar had no way to create a flow.** For a package with zero
    flows the rail rendered an endless "加载中…" (loading conflated with empty)
    and offered no create affordance, so automations could never be authored.
    It now tracks the list-loaded state (real empty state "还没有自动化 — 点「新建」开始")
    and has a "+ 新建" inline creator that saves a minimal, valid `start → end`
    autolaunched flow skeleton as a draft and opens it in the flow designer.

  - **Interfaces nav items could not be bound to a target — and silently failed
    to save.** Selecting a nav item showed no inspector, and the item shape the
    editor produced (`{ label, object }`, no `id`/`type`) failed the app spec's
    navigation union ("navigation.N: Invalid input"), so the draft never
    persisted and the published app navigation stayed empty. The right panel now
    renders a `StudioNavItemInspector` with a business-friendly object picker
    (populated from the package's published ∪ draft objects) that emits a
    spec-valid `ObjectNavItem` (`{ id, type:'object', objectName, label }`), and
    the nav save drops still-unbound placeholders + backfills a snake_case id so
    one blank item can't fail the whole save.

  Also fills in the Home builder-cover i18n keys (`home.build.*`,
  `home.template.*`) in `en`/`zh` so the "Build an app" / "Start with a template"
  cards resolve real strings instead of falling back to defaults.

## 11.3.0

### Patch Changes

- d88c8ec: fix(data-table): surface inline-edit save failures instead of swallowing them

  A rejected inline-edit save (e.g. a 400 validation failure like an invalid
  status transition) was caught with only `console.error` — the toolbar stayed
  stuck, the cell kept the unsaved value, and the author got no feedback. Now the
  data-table shows the server's reason in the toolbar (with an alert icon) and
  tints the affected row(s) destructive so it's clear which rows didn't persist.
  The pending edit is kept for retry; the error clears on a successful save or on
  cancel. Adds the `table.saveFailed` string across all locales.

## 11.2.0

## 11.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 6726a2b: First-run UX polish (objectstack-ai/objectui#2038) — copy improvements found via the ObjectOS Cloud signup walkthrough:

  - **"Organization" → "Workspace"** across the org picker (`organizations.*` strings, en + zh). The create flow + WorkspaceSwitcher already say "workspace"; the picker ("Your Organizations / No organizations yet") was the lone holdout. Now consistent.
  - **Non-admin empty state** — "There are no applications available to you yet. Please contact your workspace administrator." → "Your workspace is being set up — apps your admin shares with you will show up here." (less dead-end, en + zh).
  - **Cold-start reassurance** — new `console.loadingHint` line under the LoadingScreen steps: "Setting up a new environment can take a few moments." (en + zh).
  - **Signup value-prop** — register subtitle "Enter your information to get started" → "Create your account to start building." (en + zh).

## 7.3.0

## 7.2.0

### Patch Changes

- 8e7c1da: fix(preview): draft-preview bar no longer demands a redundant Publish when nothing is pending

  Under the auto-publish posture an AI build leaves zero pending drafts, yet opening a
  draft preview still showed "Draft preview — Nothing here is live until you publish."
  alongside "Changes (0)" and a Publish button — a self-contradicting, no-op call to
  action. `DraftPreviewBar` now reflects the real pending-draft count: when it is
  known to be zero the bar softens to a neutral preview indicator and drops the
  Publish/Changes affordances; an unknown count (still loading / fetch failed) keeps
  the publish path. `HomePage` (count-gated) and `RuntimeDraftBar` (draft-gated)
  already behaved this way — this aligns the third surface.

## 7.1.0

## 7.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 89e113c: ADR-0044 send-back-for-revision in the approvals inbox (framework #1744/#1769). Approvers get a "Send back" action (violet, with its own dialog) that ends the round as `returned` and unlocks the record; the submitter sees a revision panel on the returned request — edit-record link, optional comment, Resubmit (opens round N+1) and Recall (abandons the revision). New `returned` status badge/filter, Round-N chips (list + drawer), timeline rendering for `revise`/`resubmit` actions, `approvalsApi.sendBack/resubmit`, and ten-locale `approvalsInbox` strings.
- 18d0339: Relabel metadata-driven UI on a language switch without a page refresh (#1319)

  Switching the UI language left server-resolved metadata labels (object/field/
  view labels, action-dialog text) in the old language until a hard refresh,
  because renderers cache those labels by object name and never refetch on a
  language change.

  **`@object-ui/auth`** — `createAuthenticatedFetch` now folds the active
  `<html lang>` into `Accept-Language` on API calls (never clobbering an explicit
  header), so a switch carries the new locale on every subsequent request.

  **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `ConnectedShellInner` drops the adapter's
  locale-blind metadata cache in the render phase and remounts the metadata
  subtree via `key={language}`, so every renderer refetches in the new locale.
  The adapter and its connection sit above the key and are preserved — an in-app
  relabel, not a reconnect.

  **`@object-ui/i18n`** — dev-mode missing-key warnings: `createI18n` gains
  `warnMissingKeys` (default on outside production) wiring a deduped i18next
  `missingKeyHandler`. `useObjectLabel`'s convention-key probes are flagged so
  their intentional misses (which fall back to server metadata) stay silent.

  Pairs with the framework-side locale-aware metadata changes in
  `@objectstack/client` / `@objectstack/objectql` / `@objectstack/rest`.

### Patch Changes

- 77cc6bb: Cloud Connection bind v2 UX (cloud ADR runtime-identity-binding §2.3): the binding flow becomes one click. `CloudConnectionPanel` drops the environment-id input entirely (registration happens cloud-side at approval), auto-opens the approval page in a popup on Connect (user-code display stays as the popup-blocked fallback), and shows the registered runtime name + runtime id once bound. `DeviceAuthPage` displays the requesting device's context (`runtime_name` / `runtime_version` from the verification URL) plus an "only approve if you started this" warning — the informed-consent surface for the RFC 8628 flow. Two new `auth.device.*` keys across all locales.
- 97c6831: Localize AI workspace, shell navigation, startup, connection, toast, and chatbot affordance text across core console screens.
- c09f44e: Docs: mermaid diagrams + long-doc table of contents (ADR-0046).

  - **plugin-markdown** renders ```mermaid fenced blocks as diagrams (`<Mermaid>`: lazy-loaded mermaid, `securityLevel: 'strict'`, rendered post-`rehype-sanitize`by a trusted component, degrades to the raw source on error). Mermaid is text → SVG, so it stays within the v1 image/binary ban. Adds`extractToc(markdown)`— a TOC builder whose slugs are generated with the same`github-slugger` `rehype-slug`uses, so`#id` links resolve to the rendered heading anchors.
  - **console** `DocPage` shows a sticky right-rail table of contents (h2–h3) for docs with ≥3 headings, plus an app-independent `/apps/:packageId/docs` index already added earlier.
  - **i18n** adds `help.onThisPage` (en/zh; other locales fall back).

- 6cfa330: feat(dashboard): drill "Open in list" escape hatch + unify report drill

  Adopts the mainstream BI peek-then-escalate drill model. Drill-through opens an
  in-place drawer (keep context) and offers an "Open in list →" affordance to
  escalate to the object's full list page (sort / bulk-select / export / shareable
  URL) — the Looker / Power BI "see records → open in page" pattern.

  - New `DrillNavigationContext` (`@object-ui/react`): the app shell provides
    `openRecordList`; the renderer stays decoupled from console routing.
  - The drill drawers (pivot / dataset / chart / KPI) render the escape hatch when
    a host navigation handler is present, and hide it otherwise (self-contained
    peek). `DashboardView` provides the handler via `useOpenRecordList`.
  - `DrillDownConfig.target` gains `'navigate'` — skip the drawer and open the
    list directly; degrades to `'drawer'` when no host handler is available.
  - `ReportView` drill-through now opens the same in-place drawer (peek records →
    click a row to open a record) instead of navigating away; the escape hatch
    preserves the previous navigate-to-list behavior. Dashboard and report drill
    are now unified.
  - i18n: `dashboard.openInList` (en / zh).

- 0ad72a6: fix: pass full gantt config to renderer, render multi-value lookups in gantt tooltips, persist `bodyExtra` on dataSource actions, and complete zh/en gantt labels

  Four platform gaps that the EHR app previously worked around with `node_modules` patches:

  - **app-shell / ObjectView** — the `config.gantt → renderer props` adapter was a hardcoded 6-field whitelist, so `parentField`/`typeField` (and `baseline*`, `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `tooltipFields`, `quickFilters`, …) never reached the renderer and the chart degraded to a flat list. It now spreads the full `viewDef.gantt` first, then applies the three required defaults last (mirroring the gallery branch).
  - **plugin-gantt / ObjectGantt** — the tooltip value formatter only handled single-object lookups, so a multi-value lookup (a populated `[{name},{name}]` array) fell through to `'—'`. It now maps each array element to its display value and joins them.
  - **app-shell / useConsoleActionRuntime** — `bodyExtra` was merged only on the absolute-HTTP path; the generic `dataSource.update` path ignored it, so a pure-confirmation action (no params array) left an empty payload and persisted nothing. `bodyExtra` is now merged last on that path too, matching the documented semantics.
  - **i18n** — added the gantt labels the 9.x renderer references but the bundles lacked: `toolbar.thisWeek/thisMonth/exportPdf/saveLayout`, `viewMode.year`, `menu.add*/removeDependency/noCandidates`, the `linkType.*` and `conflict.*` blocks, and `readOnly*` — in both `en` (canonical key source) and `zh`.

- 3fa23a7: feat(header): context-aware Help & Documentation menu + app-scoped docs index

  The top-right "?" was a bare external link to `docs.objectstack.ai`, duplicating
  the left sidebar's in-product `/docs` entry and ignoring the ADR-0046 docs hub.
  It is now an aggregated, context-aware menu:

  - **This app's docs** — shown only when the current app's package owns docs
    (matched by `_packageId`). A single-doc app deep-links straight to the
    viewer; a multi-doc app lands on the new app-scoped index.
  - **All documentation** — the in-product `/docs` portal.
  - **Online documentation** — `docs.objectstack.ai` (opens in a new tab).

  Docs are lazily fetched once on first menu open (names/labels only), so the menu
  adds no cost until used; a failed fetch soft-degrades to the static entries.

  Also adds the app-scoped docs index route **`/apps/:packageId/docs`**
  (`AppDocsIndex`) — the package-scoped sibling of `/docs`, listing just that
  app's docs — which the "This app's docs" entry targets when an app ships more
  than one. New `help.*` strings added to the `en` and `zh` bundles (other
  locales fall back to `en`).

- 59b6bbb: i18n the managed-by empty states for system / append-only / better-auth object lists.

  `resolveManagedByEmptyState` previously hardcoded English titles and messages (e.g. "No identity records", "No events recorded"), so list views for managed objects (identity, audit logs, system-generated records) rendered English regardless of locale. It now takes the `t` translator and resolves `list.managedBy.{system,appendOnly,betterAuth}.{title,message}` (English kept as `defaultValue` fallbacks); `ObjectView` passes its `t` through. Added the keys to the `en` and `zh` locale packs.

- bd8b054: fix(currency): resolve the tenant default currency across the long-tail renderers

  Phase 2b of the currency-resolution work (ADR-0053). The cell/field renderers
  already funnelled through `resolveFieldCurrency` + `useLocalization` (#1856),
  but the rest of the renderers still hard-coded `USD` or read only one of
  `currency`/`defaultCurrency`. They now share the same resolution chain — explicit
  field currency -> `currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` -> legacy `defaultCurrency` ->
  tenant `localization.currency` -> plain number:

  - `plugin-dashboard` `ObjectMetricWidget` (inferred currency), `ObjectDataTable`
    (symbol-format fallback).
  - `plugin-grid` `useColumnSummary` (footer agrees with the cells) and
    `ObjectGrid` (compact amount + name-inferred currency cells).
  - `plugin-detail` `DetailView` summary metrics.
  - `plugin-gantt` `ObjectGantt` currency tooltips.
  - `components` `element:number` (`format: 'currency'`) — tenant default instead
    of a baked-in `USD`, and renders with the tenant locale.

  `resolveFieldCurrency` now lives in `@object-ui/i18n` (co-located with
  `useLocalization`, which supplies the tenant default); `@object-ui/fields`
  re-exports it, so the existing import path is unchanged. No behavior change when
  no tenant currency is configured — a field that declares its own currency, or a
  deployment with no `localization.currency`, renders exactly as before.

- 2f31406: Refine Studio package-scoped navigation and home overview.

  Studio now treats the selected package as the home overview scope, flattens the root Overview sidebar group, hides the duplicate all-metadata sidebar entry, redirects the invalid package metadata route to package management, preserves the selected package across package-management navigation, and adds a localized package-management sidebar label.

### Minor Changes

- b2d1704: feat(cmdk): record search across objects in the Command Palette
  - New `useRecordSearch` hook in `@object-ui/react` debounces a query, fans out
    to `dataSource.find(name, { $search, $top })` across candidate objects, and
    aggregates hits. Race-safe via a monotonic runId; per-object 404s are
    silently dropped via `Promise.allSettled`.
  - `CommandPalette` (`@object-ui/app-shell`) now accepts a `dataSource` prop;
    when supplied, the palette renders a `Records` group at the top with hits
    scoped to the active app's nav objects. Item `value` embeds the live query
    so cmdk's client-side filter doesn't hide async results.
  - Added `console.commandPalette.records` i18n key (`Records` / `记录`).

### Patch Changes

- 321294c: Cmd-K now shows recently viewed records in its empty state, sourced
  from the existing cloud-synced `sys_user_preference` adapter (already
  wired by `RecentItemsProvider` + `useTrackRouteAsRecent` +
  `RecordDetailView`). Multi-device by construction: open a record on
  laptop, see it in `⌘K → Recently viewed` on phone.
  - Group renders only when input is empty (no competition with search).
  - Limited to the 5 most recent record-type entries.
  - New i18n key `console.commandPalette.recentRecords` (en + zh seeded;
    other locales fall back to `defaultValue: "Recently viewed"`).

- 0a644f0: feat(app-shell): CommandPalette searching indicator

  When `useRecordSearch` is mid-flight (debounced fetch across objects
  hasn't returned yet), the palette now surfaces a subtle visual:
  - A small pulsing primary-coloured dot next to the **Records** group
    heading, so the user sees that more results may still appear.
  - A `Searching…` placeholder inside the empty state when the user has
    typed something but no hits exist yet — replaces the static
    "No results found." message until the request settles.

  New i18n key `console.commandPalette.searching` (en + zh).

- a3cb88f: CRM UX polish batch:
  - Kanban columns: drop the per-column rainbow top stripe. Lane border + header divider are sufficient; cards are now the loudest thing on screen (Linear / HubSpot pattern).
  - Stage chevron (`record:path`): bump completed-stage contrast (emerald-800 text on emerald-500/15, was 700 on /10) and future-stage text from `foreground/70` to `foreground/85` for legibility.
  - i18n: add `notifications.emptyUnread`, `notifications.filterUnread`, `notifications.filterAll` (en + zh) so the InboxPopover Unread/All sub-filter renders in the active locale.
- 5425608: CRM UX polish pass — calmer enterprise look across detail + kanban.
  - **plugin-kanban**: column headers now use a 2px muted accent stripe with
    neutral foreground titles + a quiet grey count pill instead of full
    rainbow gradient + colored title + colored count. Pipeline boards
    (Opportunity, Case, Task, Lead) look like Salesforce/Linear instead of
    a toy. WIP-limit overflow remains destructive-red so urgency stays loud.
  - **plugin-detail (`record:reference_rail`)**: new `hideEmpty` prop
    (default true) collapses entries whose total === 0 into a single
    `+ N empty (Quotes · Products …)` chip at the bottom of the rail.
    Removes the 4–7 "No records" stack that dominated the aside.
  - **plugin-detail (`record:path`)**: completed stages now render with an
    emerald-tinted background + bold green check instead of low-contrast
    `bg-muted text-muted-foreground` (which read as "light grey on white"
    and was borderline unreadable).
  - **app-shell (`RecordDetailView`)**: record-not-found short-circuit.
    Previously a stale/missing recordId still rendered the page chrome
    (rail, discussion, breadcrumb with the raw id), making invalid links
    look like a partially broken page. Now renders a clean centered
    `Empty` state with database icon + i18n'd "Record not found" copy.
  - **i18n**: added `detail.showEmptyRelated_{one,other}` and
    `empty.recordNotFound{,Description}` keys (en + zh).

- e919433: Stop silently assuming USD when a currency field has no `currency`
  configured. For non-USD orgs (e.g. a CNY-based CRM seeded without an
  explicit currency) the cells now render as plain locale-formatted
  numbers (`150,000.00`) instead of `$150,000.00` — which was the #1
  "why is my RMB showing as dollars?" bug.

  Behavior change is opt-in via omission: when `currency` /
  `defaultCurrency` is set on the field/column, formatting is unchanged.

  Fixed call sites:
  - `@object-ui/fields`: `formatCurrency`, `formatCompactCurrency`, and
    `CurrencyCellRenderer` no longer default-param `'USD'`.
  - `@object-ui/i18n`: `formatCurrency()` falls back to `formatNumber`
    semantics when `currency` is omitted.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid`: column-summary formatter (`Sum: 5,000,000`
    instead of `Sum: $5,000,000.00`).
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: header-highlight currency formatter.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`: `ObjectMetricWidget` inferred
    currency now resolves to `undefined` (not `'USD'`) for un-tagged
    fields, so `MetricWidget`'s `isCurrency` heuristic falls through
    to plain number formatting.

- d9c3bae: `RichTextField` now translates its inline hints (`Format: markdown`,
  `Rich text editor (basic)`, `Enter text...`) instead of hardcoding
  English. Adds `fields.richText.*` keys to the en / zh locale packs.

## 5.1.1

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 49b1760: Polish the ConcurrentUpdateDialog and add i18n.
  - Internationalise all dialog strings (title, body, button labels, "your edit" / "current value" headings, audit-trail line) through `useDetailTranslation`. Locale strings added to `@object-ui/i18n` for English and Chinese.
  - Replace the plain dialog header with an amber warning badge + `AlertTriangle` icon to communicate that this is a conflict, not a routine confirmation.
  - Visually differentiate the two value blocks: amber tint for the user's pending edit, sky tint for the server's current value. Both wrap long values cleanly.
  - Surface audit provenance for the racer's write (`updated_at`, plus `updated_by_name`/`updated_by_label` when supplied). Opaque ID-looking `updated_by` tokens are suppressed.
  - Re-prioritise the action buttons: **Reload latest** is now the primary/recommended action (autofocused), **Overwrite anyway** is rendered as a destructive-outline button so the dangerous path requires deliberate intent, and **Cancel** falls back to a ghost variant.

- c0b236f: Platform detail/form polish:
  - **Auto-section grouping**: When an object has no authored `views.form.sections`, the detail page now splits fields into a primary section and a collapsible "More details" section based on a field-type/name heuristic (textarea / markdown / description / notes / remarks). Eliminates the wall-of-fields layout on objects without explicit detail metadata.
  - **FormSection card chrome**: `FormSection` now accepts `showBorder`. Defaults to `true` for titled sections (Card wrapper) and `false` for untitled sections (flat). Same auto-default already applied to `DetailSection`.
  - **Origin breadcrumb**: Navigating from a list/kanban into a record now records the source view; the detail page shows a `← <view label>` back-link above the page header.
  - New i18n key `detail.sectionMoreDetails` (en + zh-CN).

### Patch Changes

- 1976691: Fix the drawer "Open as full page" (maximize) button on the record drawer
  which threw `TypeError: name.indexOf is not a function` and prevented
  navigation to the dedicated detail page.
  - `@object-ui/app-shell` `ObjectView`: pass `objectDef.name` (string) — not
    the whole `objectDef` — into `viewLabel(...)` when computing the
    `originState.from.label` for both drawer-navigate and list-navigate
    flows. Two call sites fixed.
  - `@object-ui/i18n` `useObjectLabel`: harden `stripNamespace` so it
    tolerates non-string inputs and returns an empty string instead of
    throwing, providing a safety net for similar future regressions.

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- cab6a93: **plugin-grid:** column summary footer now formats values using the
  column's type metadata. Currency columns render `Sum: $1,760,000.00`
  instead of bare `Sum: 1,760,000`; percent columns honor `0–1` vs
  `0–100` value ranges; avg uses two fraction digits. `useColumnSummary`
  accepts an optional `fieldMetadata` map (typically `objectSchema.fields`)
  so per-field `type`, `currency`, `defaultCurrency`, `precision` are
  respected.

  **plugin-gantt:** added safe-fallback `useGanttTranslation` hook. All
  hardcoded toolbar `aria-label`s and the `Task Name` / `Start` / `End` /
  `Today` column-header strings now flow through `t('gantt.*')`. A new
  `gantt.*` section is exported from the en/zh/ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/ru/ar
  locales.

  **app-shell:** `ReportView` no longer hardcodes the `Edit` button label
  or the `Loading report…` fallback — they now use `common.edit` and
  `common.loading`.

  **i18n:** added top-level `gantt` section (with English fallbacks in
  non-en/zh locales) and the `common.addToFavorites` /
  `common.removeFromFavorites` keys across all ten built-in locales so
  the `builtInLocales` parity tests pass.

## 5.0.1

## 5.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 8930b15: feat(detail): close the gap between Page-assigned and default record detail pages (Track 1)

  Custom Lightning-style record detail pages (assigned via `assignedPage` /
  `Page` schemas) used to feel meaningfully poorer than the auto-generated
  default detail view. They were missing cross-cutting affordances and
  shipped with English-only tab labels and heavy bordered section cards
  even when the host locale was Chinese. Track 1 closes the visible gap:
  - **app-shell `RecordDetailView`**: the `assignedPage` branch now wears
    the same chrome as the default branch — lifecycle managed-by badge
    and presence avatars in the top-right, `MetadataPanel` debug panel,
    `ActionConfirmDialog` / `ActionParamDialog`, and an auto-appended
    `RecordChatterPanel` at the bottom of the page. Authors opt out of
    the auto-discussion with `assignedPage.disableDiscussion = true`.
  - **plugin-detail `record:details`**: defaults to `inlineEdit: true` so
    fields are click-to-edit just like the default page, and synthesises
    sections with `showBorder: false` by default so a Lightning page
    doesn't double-wrap every block in a heavy Card.
  - **components `page:tabs` / `page:accordion`**: well-known English
    labels (Details / Related / Activity / History / Notes / Files /
    Tasks / Events / Attachments / Chatter / Discussion / Comments /
    Overview / Summary) auto-translate to Chinese (`zh-CN` / `zh-TW`)
    via a built-in dictionary keyed off `document.documentElement.lang`.
    Authors supplying explicit localised labels (string or
    `{ default, zh-CN, ... }`) are not affected.
  - **i18n provider**: applies the initial language to
    `document.documentElement.lang` on mount (i18next does not fire
    `languageChanged` for the bootstrap language), so locale-aware
    renderers downstream see the right value from the first render.

## 4.8.0

## 4.7.0

## 4.6.0

## 4.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 22fa558: Clean up pre-existing TypeScript errors in `plugin-list` and tighten i18n:
  - Switch grouping-editor labels to `t(key, { defaultValue })` option form so i18next's strict types accept the literal fallback.
  - Add the missing `list.addGroup` / `list.collapsedByDefault` / `list.removeGroup` keys to en + zh locale bundles.
  - Drop the dead `currentView === 'list'` branch in `ListView` (local `ViewType` union has `'grid'`, never `'list'`).
  - Widen `UserFilters.resolveFields` `translateOptions` parameter from a generic `<T>` to the concrete option shape so it matches the `useObjectLabel` hook's signature.

## 4.4.0

## 4.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 5f4ac6e: fix(i18n): add notifications + organizations namespaces to all 8 non-en/zh locales (ar/de/es/fr/ja/ko/pt/ru) to restore top-level key parity. Resolves the long-standing i18n.test.ts locale-parity failure.

## 4.3.0

### Patch Changes

- f196cf4: feat(plugin-report): popup picker for groupings + section-aware test ids

  The matrix/summary "Group by" (rows) and "Columns axis" (cols) sections now
  share the same searchable popup picker as the columns section, with a
  commit-on-select single-pick mode wired through `FieldPickerDialog`.
  - Per-row field buttons display the human-readable field label and open a
    dialog scoped to swap that single field (already-used fields filtered out)
  - "Add grouping" trigger uses the same dialog
  - `GroupingsBuilder` accepts a `testIdPrefix` prop; ReportConfigPanel passes
    `rows-grouping` and `cols-grouping` so both instances no longer share the
    ambiguous `grouping-field-0` testid
  - Bigger row spacing (h-7 / text-xs) — the old `text-[10px]` was unreadable

  `FieldPickerDialog` gains:
  - `commitOnSelect`: hides the Confirm/Cancel footer; clicking a row commits
    - closes immediately (intended for `singleSelect` flows)
  - `trigger`: custom trigger element override (used by the per-row field button)

- ee1cc96: feat(plugin-report): joined-report block editor

  `type: 'joined'` reports were a black hole in the editor — the type
  selector exposed them but no UI knew how to edit the `blocks` array,
  so users could neither create nor modify joined reports without
  hand-editing JSON.

  This change adds a `Blocks` section to the report editor, visible only
  when `type === 'joined'`. Each block renders as a collapsible card with
  its own name (required + unique-validated), label, description, block
  type, object override, and reuses the existing `ColumnsEditor`,
  `GroupingsBuilder`, `SpecFilterAdapter`, and `ChartConfig` builders so
  every block behaves like a mini standalone report — matching the
  runtime contract of `JoinedReportRenderer`.

  Block-level validation is surfaced in the main `ValidationBanner`:
  empty blocks array, missing or duplicate block names, and blocks
  without columns all become editor-time errors so saves stay safe.

  The non-joined sections (Columns / Rows / Columns axis / Filters /
  Chart) are hidden when `type === 'joined'` since they live per-block
  in the spec.

  New exports from `@object-ui/plugin-report`:
  - `JoinedBlocksEditor` — standalone component for embedding the
    block editor anywhere.
  - `validateJoinedBlocks` — pure helper returning translated
    problem strings, suitable for custom validation banners.
  - `ColumnsEditor`, `GroupingsBuilder`, `ChartConfig`,
    `SpecFilterAdapter`, `normalizeColumns` are now exported so
    downstream consumers can build their own report-editor surfaces.

  i18n: added `report.editor.blocks*` / `report.editor.addBlock` /
  `report.editor.removeBlock` / `report.editor.blockName*` /
  `report.editor.blockLabel*` / `report.editor.blockDescription*` /
  `report.editor.validationJoinedNeedsBlocks` /
  `report.editor.validationBlockNameRequired` /
  `report.editor.validationBlockNameDuplicate` /
  `report.editor.validationBlockNeedsColumns` to en + zh.

- 0b032be: feat(plugin-report): replace inline column picker with a popup field picker

  The columns section now opens a Dialog-based multi-select picker (`FieldPickerDialog`)
  instead of rendering the unselected field list inline. The popup supports search,
  batched multi-selection (commit several fields in one click), per-field type badges,
  cancel-discards-pending semantics, and is fully i18n'd. Also fixes a latent
  `ReferenceError: normalizeColumns is not defined` that crashed the editor whenever
  the chart section was expanded.

- 115d36a: i18n: native translations for the report editor (`report.editor.*`) in 8 locales — ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru. Previously these locales had the English placeholder strings copy-pasted from `en.ts` and the newer `blocks*`, `addCondition`, `opContains`, `formatCurrency` etc. keys were missing entirely (so the report editor surfaced raw key names in those languages). All locales now carry the full key set with locale-appropriate copy.
- 4e7bc1b: **Report editor panel overhaul**

  The report configuration panel is now safe to open on any spec-shape `Report` and only exposes fields that are actually persisted by `@objectstack/spec`.

  `@object-ui/plugin-report`:
  - Add a bidirectional `SpecFilterAdapter` so `ReportConfigPanel` can edit
    spec `FilterCondition` filters (`{field: value}`, `{field: {$op: value}}`,
    top-level `$and`/`$or`). Complex / nested filters fall back to a
    read-only banner and are preserved verbatim on save.
  - Drop sections that never round-tripped through the spec
    (`conditionalFormatting`, `sections`, `export`, `schedule`, `appearance`)
    and their helper components.
  - Add type-driven section visibility: `tabular` shows Columns/Filters,
    `summary` adds Rows + Chart, `matrix` adds Rows + Columns axis + Chart.
  - New `GroupingsBuilder` covers `groupingsDown`/`groupingsAcross` with
    `sortOrder` and date-aware `dateGranularity` controls.
  - New `ColumnsEditor` lets users reorder picked columns, override labels,
    set aggregates and choose a display format.
  - Chart subset now mirrors the spec: chart `title`, `showLegend`,
    `showDataLabels`, plus `funnel` (scatter removed).
  - Validation banner highlights missing `objectName` and missing
    rows/columns for `matrix`/`summary` reports.
  - All editor labels and hints are i18n-driven (`report.editor.*`).
  - 18 new unit tests cover the filter adapter round-trip.

  `@object-ui/components`:
  - `FilterBuilder` now guards against malformed external `value` props.
    Previously a spec-shape filter (`{is_active: true}`) would crash the
    component on first render; the builder now falls back to an empty
    AND group whenever `value` is not a valid `FilterGroup`.

  `@object-ui/i18n`:
  - Add `report.editor.*` strings to `en` and `zh`.

- 8442c05: Improve report editor panel usability based on real-user browser testing:
  - **Wider config panel** — the report editor now defaults to a `--config-panel-width`
    of 440px (up from 280px), driven by a new optional `style` prop on
    `ConfigPanelRenderer`. Long field labels, report titles, type labels, and filter
    rows no longer truncate to "Account Na" / "kup" / "ct" / 1-character widths.
  - **Disambiguated "Columns" sections** — for `summary` and `matrix` reports the
    measure list is now labelled **"Values / 度量"** (pivot-style vocabulary) instead
    of "Columns", which previously clashed with the matrix's pivot column axis
    (also called "Columns / 列"). The two sections used to be indistinguishable.
    New i18n key `report.editor.values` / `valuesHint` is shipped for all 10
    locales (en, zh, ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru).
  - **Reordered sections for matrix/summary** — the editor now surfaces _Rows_
    and _Columns_ (the pivot axes) **before** _Values_, mirroring how a business
    user thinks about a pivot table.
  - **Per-row aggregate/format headers** — each column row in `ColumnsEditor` now
    shows small "Aggregate" / "Format" labels above the respective selects, and
    the row uses a 2-line layout so the label input has its own line. The cramped
    3-dropdowns-side-by-side layout at 10px font is gone.
  - **Searchable field picker** — the "Add columns" list now has a search box,
    a `filtered / total` counter, an empty-state message, and a scrollable bordered
    container. New i18n keys: `report.editor.searchFields`,
    `report.editor.noMatchingFields`.

## 4.2.1

## 4.2.0

### Patch Changes

- eb738bd: fix(i18n): add missing top-level `report` key to ar/de/es/fr/ja/ko/pt/ru locales

  The i18n parity test (`all locales have the same top-level keys`) was failing
  because the `report` key existed only in `en` and `zh`. The other built-in
  locales now include the same `report` block (English fallback strings) so the
  CI parity check passes again.

- 650392e: MatrixRenderer now displays i18n-translated labels for picklist (`select` / `status`) groupings instead of raw values (e.g. `Best Case` / `Commit` / `Pipeline` instead of `best_case` / `commit` / `pipeline`). Field labels in the corner cell, row/column total labels, and the `(Empty)` / `(All)` placeholders are also fully translated. Adds `report.*` keys to `en` and `zh` locale bundles.
- 84b4bf1: Summary reports now render i18n-translated labels in the chart axis, chart series legend, and totals strip. `buildChartData` accepts a new `labels` parameter so callers (currently `SpecReportGrid`) can supply field/column/aggregate/value resolvers. Replaces raw column keys (e.g. `Count of case_number`) and raw picklist values (e.g. `closed`, `in_progress`) with their translated display labels (e.g. `案例编号 · 计数`, `已关闭`, `处理中`). Adds `report.totals` locale key.

## 4.1.0

## 4.0.12

## 4.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 1909bc3: Add `transformSpecTranslations` / `isSpecTranslationData` helpers to
  `@object-ui/i18n` so apps no longer need to maintain their own copy of the
  `@objectstack/spec` `TranslationData` → flat namespace transform.

  The new transform preserves **every** `_`-prefixed object scope by
  convention (`_views`, `_actions`, `_sections`, `_notifications`, `_errors`,
  `_options`, plus anything added in future spec versions), which fixes a
  class of silent-failure regressions where new spec scopes were dropped
  during transformation — leaving e.g. list-view labels to fall back to the
  untranslated source string.

  `@object-ui/console`'s `loadLanguage.ts` is rewritten to delegate to the
  shared helper.

## 4.0.10

## 4.0.9

## 4.0.8

### Patch Changes

- 3d58eaa: fix(auth,app-shell): hide Log out menu item when auth is disabled (guest/preview mode)

  When the console runs against a server with `discovery.services.auth.enabled === false`
  (or in preview mode), `AuthProvider` hardcodes `isAuthenticated: true` and the mock
  `signOut()` has no real backend. Previously, clicking "Log out" in the user menu had
  no visible effect — the user/session were nulled but the UI stayed authenticated.

  Changes:
  - **`@object-ui/auth`** — added `isAuthEnabled: boolean` to `AuthContextValue`
    (`true` only when real auth is in use, `false` for guest/preview modes).
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `AppHeader` and `AppSidebar` now hide the "Log out"
    menu item entirely when `!isAuthEnabled`, so users aren't presented with an action
    that can't actually do anything. Also fixed two missed i18n strings in
    `AppSidebar` ("Settings", "Log out").
  - **`@object-ui/i18n`** — added `user.{profile,settings,logout}` namespace to all
    10 built-in locales (en/zh translated; ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/ru/ar fall back to
    English pending native translation).

## 4.0.7

### Patch Changes

- fd15918: Comprehensive i18n refactor + CI test fix.

  **i18n (`@object-ui/i18n`)**
  - Added ~130 new keys under 12 new top-level namespaces: `layout`, `search`,
    `empty`, `renderer`, `actionDialog`, `rowAction`, `navigationSync`,
    `objectActions`, `objectViewActions`, `dashboardActions`, `recordDetail`,
    `cellRender`, plus `grid.{empty,yes,no,systemFields,openMenu}`.
  - Mirrored all new top-level namespaces to all 10 built-in locales
    (en, zh, ja, ko, de, fr, es, pt, ru, ar) to maintain key parity required
    by the locale-structure test. Non-en/zh locales seed with English values
    and rely on `fallbackLng: 'en'` until human translation lands.

  **App shell (`@object-ui/app-shell`)** — replaced hardcoded English in 14
  files with `useObjectTranslation`:
  - Layout: `AppSidebar`, `ActivityFeed` (locale-aware relative time),
    `MetadataInspector`.
  - Views: `SearchResultsPage`, `ActionParamDialog`, `RecordFormPage`,
    `RecordDetailView`, `PageView`, `DashboardView` (PDF / forecast toasts),
    `ReportView`, `ObjectView` (rename / delete view toasts).
  - Console: `AppContent` (no-apps empty state).
  - Components: `PageRenderer`, `FormRenderer`, `DashboardRenderer`.
  - Hooks: `useNavigationSync` (16 toasts incl. Undo label),
    `useObjectActions` (delete confirm + success / failure toasts).

  **Plugin grid (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**
  - `ObjectGrid` record-detail panel now translates Empty / Yes / No / System
    via the existing `useGridTranslation` safe-fallback wrapper.
  - `RowActionMenu` adopts a local safe-fallback i18n wrapper for
    `Open menu` / `Edit` / `Delete`, preserving standalone-usage guarantees.

  **CLI test fix (`@object-ui/cli`)**
  - `cli-bin.test.ts` auto-builds the package on first run when `dist/cli.js`
    is missing, instead of throwing. This unbreaks `pnpm test:coverage` in CI
    (root vitest run does not honor turbo's `^build` deps) and removes the
    manual `pnpm --filter @object-ui/cli build` requirement for local dev.

## 4.0.6

## 4.0.5

## 4.0.4

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
