### Minor Changes

- 89e113c: ADR-0044 send-back-for-revision in the approvals inbox (framework #1744/#1769). Approvers get a "Send back" action (violet, with its own dialog) that ends the round as `returned` and unlocks the record; the submitter sees a revision panel on the returned request — edit-record link, optional comment, Resubmit (opens round N+1) and Recall (abandons the revision). New `returned` status badge/filter, Round-N chips (list + drawer), timeline rendering for `revise`/`resubmit` actions, `approvalsApi.sendBack/resubmit`, and ten-locale `approvalsInbox` strings.
- 18d0339: Relabel metadata-driven UI on a language switch without a page refresh (#1319)

  Switching the UI language left server-resolved metadata labels (object/field/
  view labels, action-dialog text) in the old language until a hard refresh,
  because renderers cache those labels by object name and never refetch on a
  language change.

  **`@object-ui/auth`** — `createAuthenticatedFetch` now folds the active
  `<html lang>` into `Accept-Language` on API calls (never clobbering an explicit
  header), so a switch carries the new locale on every subsequent request.

  **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `ConnectedShellInner` drops the adapter's
  locale-blind metadata cache in the render phase and remounts the metadata
  subtree via `key={language}`, so every renderer refetches in the new locale.
  The adapter and its connection sit above the key and are preserved — an in-app
  relabel, not a reconnect.

  **`@object-ui/i18n`** — dev-mode missing-key warnings: `createI18n` gains
  `warnMissingKeys` (default on outside production) wiring a deduped i18next
  `missingKeyHandler`. `useObjectLabel`'s convention-key probes are flagged so
  their intentional misses (which fall back to server metadata) stay silent.

  Pairs with the framework-side locale-aware metadata changes in
  `@objectstack/client` / `@objectstack/objectql` / `@objectstack/rest`.

### Patch Changes

- 77cc6bb: Cloud Connection bind v2 UX (cloud ADR runtime-identity-binding §2.3): the binding flow becomes one click. `CloudConnectionPanel` drops the environment-id input entirely (registration happens cloud-side at approval), auto-opens the approval page in a popup on Connect (user-code display stays as the popup-blocked fallback), and shows the registered runtime name + runtime id once bound. `DeviceAuthPage` displays the requesting device's context (`runtime_name` / `runtime_version` from the verification URL) plus an "only approve if you started this" warning — the informed-consent surface for the RFC 8628 flow. Two new `auth.device.*` keys across all locales.
- 97c6831: Localize AI workspace, shell navigation, startup, connection, toast, and chatbot affordance text across core console screens.
- c09f44e: Docs: mermaid diagrams + long-doc table of contents (ADR-0046).

  - **plugin-markdown** renders ```mermaid fenced blocks as diagrams (`<Mermaid>`: lazy-loaded mermaid, `securityLevel: 'strict'`, rendered post-`rehype-sanitize`by a trusted component, degrades to the raw source on error). Mermaid is text → SVG, so it stays within the v1 image/binary ban. Adds`extractToc(markdown)`— a TOC builder whose slugs are generated with the same`github-slugger` `rehype-slug`uses, so`#id` links resolve to the rendered heading anchors.
  - **console** `DocPage` shows a sticky right-rail table of contents (h2–h3) for docs with ≥3 headings, plus an app-independent `/apps/:packageId/docs` index already added earlier.
  - **i18n** adds `help.onThisPage` (en/zh; other locales fall back).

- 6cfa330: feat(dashboard): drill "Open in list" escape hatch + unify report drill

  Adopts the mainstream BI peek-then-escalate drill model. Drill-through opens an
  in-place drawer (keep context) and offers an "Open in list →" affordance to
  escalate to the object's full list page (sort / bulk-select / export / shareable
  URL) — the Looker / Power BI "see records → open in page" pattern.

  - New `DrillNavigationContext` (`@object-ui/react`): the app shell provides
    `openRecordList`; the renderer stays decoupled from console routing.
  - The drill drawers (pivot / dataset / chart / KPI) render the escape hatch when
    a host navigation handler is present, and hide it otherwise (self-contained
    peek). `DashboardView` provides the handler via `useOpenRecordList`.
  - `DrillDownConfig.target` gains `'navigate'` — skip the drawer and open the
    list directly; degrades to `'drawer'` when no host handler is available.
  - `ReportView` drill-through now opens the same in-place drawer (peek records →
    click a row to open a record) instead of navigating away; the escape hatch
    preserves the previous navigate-to-list behavior. Dashboard and report drill
    are now unified.
  - i18n: `dashboard.openInList` (en / zh).

- 0ad72a6: fix: pass full gantt config to renderer, render multi-value lookups in gantt tooltips, persist `bodyExtra` on dataSource actions, and complete zh/en gantt labels

  Four platform gaps that the EHR app previously worked around with `node_modules` patches:

  - **app-shell / ObjectView** — the `config.gantt → renderer props` adapter was a hardcoded 6-field whitelist, so `parentField`/`typeField` (and `baseline*`, `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `tooltipFields`, `quickFilters`, …) never reached the renderer and the chart degraded to a flat list. It now spreads the full `viewDef.gantt` first, then applies the three required defaults last (mirroring the gallery branch).
  - **plugin-gantt / ObjectGantt** — the tooltip value formatter only handled single-object lookups, so a multi-value lookup (a populated `[{name},{name}]` array) fell through to `'—'`. It now maps each array element to its display value and joins them.
  - **app-shell / useConsoleActionRuntime** — `bodyExtra` was merged only on the absolute-HTTP path; the generic `dataSource.update` path ignored it, so a pure-confirmation action (no params array) left an empty payload and persisted nothing. `bodyExtra` is now merged last on that path too, matching the documented semantics.
  - **i18n** — added the gantt labels the 9.x renderer references but the bundles lacked: `toolbar.thisWeek/thisMonth/exportPdf/saveLayout`, `viewMode.year`, `menu.add*/removeDependency/noCandidates`, the `linkType.*` and `conflict.*` blocks, and `readOnly*` — in both `en` (canonical key source) and `zh`.

- 3fa23a7: feat(header): context-aware Help & Documentation menu + app-scoped docs index

  The top-right "?" was a bare external link to `docs.objectstack.ai`, duplicating
  the left sidebar's in-product `/docs` entry and ignoring the ADR-0046 docs hub.
  It is now an aggregated, context-aware menu:

  - **This app's docs** — shown only when the current app's package owns docs
    (matched by `_packageId`). A single-doc app deep-links straight to the
    viewer; a multi-doc app lands on the new app-scoped index.
  - **All documentation** — the in-product `/docs` portal.
  - **Online documentation** — `docs.objectstack.ai` (opens in a new tab).

  Docs are lazily fetched once on first menu open (names/labels only), so the menu
  adds no cost until used; a failed fetch soft-degrades to the static entries.

  Also adds the app-scoped docs index route **`/apps/:packageId/docs`**
  (`AppDocsIndex`) — the package-scoped sibling of `/docs`, listing just that
  app's docs — which the "This app's docs" entry targets when an app ships more
  than one. New `help.*` strings added to the `en` and `zh` bundles (other
  locales fall back to `en`).

- 59b6bbb: i18n the managed-by empty states for system / append-only / better-auth object lists.

  `resolveManagedByEmptyState` previously hardcoded English titles and messages (e.g. "No identity records", "No events recorded"), so list views for managed objects (identity, audit logs, system-generated records) rendered English regardless of locale. It now takes the `t` translator and resolves `list.managedBy.{system,appendOnly,betterAuth}.{title,message}` (English kept as `defaultValue` fallbacks); `ObjectView` passes its `t` through. Added the keys to the `en` and `zh` locale packs.

- bd8b054: fix(currency): resolve the tenant default currency across the long-tail renderers

  Phase 2b of the currency-resolution work (ADR-0053). The cell/field renderers
  already funnelled through `resolveFieldCurrency` + `useLocalization` (#1856),
  but the rest of the renderers still hard-coded `USD` or read only one of
  `currency`/`defaultCurrency`. They now share the same resolution chain — explicit
  field currency -> `currencyConfig.defaultCurrency` -> legacy `defaultCurrency` ->
  tenant `localization.currency` -> plain number:

  - `plugin-dashboard` `ObjectMetricWidget` (inferred currency), `ObjectDataTable`
    (symbol-format fallback).
  - `plugin-grid` `useColumnSummary` (footer agrees with the cells) and
    `ObjectGrid` (compact amount + name-inferred currency cells).
  - `plugin-detail` `DetailView` summary metrics.
  - `plugin-gantt` `ObjectGantt` currency tooltips.
  - `components` `element:number` (`format: 'currency'`) — tenant default instead
    of a baked-in `USD`, and renders with the tenant locale.

  `resolveFieldCurrency` now lives in `@object-ui/i18n` (co-located with
  `useLocalization`, which supplies the tenant default); `@object-ui/fields`
  re-exports it, so the existing import path is unchanged. No behavior change when
  no tenant currency is configured — a field that declares its own currency, or a
  deployment with no `localization.currency`, renders exactly as before.

- 2f31406: Refine Studio package-scoped navigation and home overview.

  Studio now treats the selected package as the home overview scope, flattens the root Overview sidebar group, hides the duplicate all-metadata sidebar entry, redirects the invalid package metadata route to package management, preserves the selected package across package-management navigation, and adds a localized package-management sidebar label.

### Minor Changes

- b2d1704: feat(cmdk): record search across objects in the Command Palette
  - New `useRecordSearch` hook in `@object-ui/react` debounces a query, fans out
    to `dataSource.find(name, { $search, $top })` across candidate objects, and
    aggregates hits. Race-safe via a monotonic runId; per-object 404s are
    silently dropped via `Promise.allSettled`.
  - `CommandPalette` (`@object-ui/app-shell`) now accepts a `dataSource` prop;
    when supplied, the palette renders a `Records` group at the top with hits
    scoped to the active app's nav objects. Item `value` embeds the live query
    so cmdk's client-side filter doesn't hide async results.
  - Added `console.commandPalette.records` i18n key (`Records` / `记录`).

### Patch Changes

- 321294c: Cmd-K now shows recently viewed records in its empty state, sourced
  from the existing cloud-synced `sys_user_preference` adapter (already
  wired by `RecentItemsProvider` + `useTrackRouteAsRecent` +
  `RecordDetailView`). Multi-device by construction: open a record on
  laptop, see it in `⌘K → Recently viewed` on phone.
  - Group renders only when input is empty (no competition with search).
  - Limited to the 5 most recent record-type entries.
  - New i18n key `console.commandPalette.recentRecords` (en + zh seeded;
    other locales fall back to `defaultValue: "Recently viewed"`).

- 0a644f0: feat(app-shell): CommandPalette searching indicator

  When `useRecordSearch` is mid-flight (debounced fetch across objects
  hasn't returned yet), the palette now surfaces a subtle visual:
  - A small pulsing primary-coloured dot next to the **Records** group
    heading, so the user sees that more results may still appear.
  - A `Searching…` placeholder inside the empty state when the user has
    typed something but no hits exist yet — replaces the static
    "No results found." message until the request settles.

  New i18n key `console.commandPalette.searching` (en + zh).

- a3cb88f: CRM UX polish batch:
  - Kanban columns: drop the per-column rainbow top stripe. Lane border + header divider are sufficient; cards are now the loudest thing on screen (Linear / HubSpot pattern).
  - Stage chevron (`record:path`): bump completed-stage contrast (emerald-800 text on emerald-500/15, was 700 on /10) and future-stage text from `foreground/70` to `foreground/85` for legibility.
  - i18n: add `notifications.emptyUnread`, `notifications.filterUnread`, `notifications.filterAll` (en + zh) so the InboxPopover Unread/All sub-filter renders in the active locale.
- 5425608: CRM UX polish pass — calmer enterprise look across detail + kanban.
  - **plugin-kanban**: column headers now use a 2px muted accent stripe with
    neutral foreground titles + a quiet grey count pill instead of full
    rainbow gradient + colored title + colored count. Pipeline boards
    (Opportunity, Case, Task, Lead) look like Salesforce/Linear instead of
    a toy. WIP-limit overflow remains destructive-red so urgency stays loud.
  - **plugin-detail (`record:reference_rail`)**: new `hideEmpty` prop
    (default true) collapses entries whose total === 0 into a single
    `+ N empty (Quotes · Products …)` chip at the bottom of the rail.
    Removes the 4–7 "No records" stack that dominated the aside.
  - **plugin-detail (`record:path`)**: completed stages now render with an
    emerald-tinted background + bold green check instead of low-contrast
    `bg-muted text-muted-foreground` (which read as "light grey on white"
    and was borderline unreadable).
  - **app-shell (`RecordDetailView`)**: record-not-found short-circuit.
    Previously a stale/missing recordId still rendered the page chrome
    (rail, discussion, breadcrumb with the raw id), making invalid links
    look like a partially broken page. Now renders a clean centered
    `Empty` state with database icon + i18n'd "Record not found" copy.
  - **i18n**: added `detail.showEmptyRelated_{one,other}` and
    `empty.recordNotFound{,Description}` keys (en + zh).

- e919433: Stop silently assuming USD when a currency field has no `currency`
  configured. For non-USD orgs (e.g. a CNY-based CRM seeded without an
  explicit currency) the cells now render as plain locale-formatted
  numbers (`150,000.00`) instead of `$150,000.00` — which was the #1
  "why is my RMB showing as dollars?" bug.

  Behavior change is opt-in via omission: when `currency` /
  `defaultCurrency` is set on the field/column, formatting is unchanged.

  Fixed call sites:
  - `@object-ui/fields`: `formatCurrency`, `formatCompactCurrency`, and
    `CurrencyCellRenderer` no longer default-param `'USD'`.
  - `@object-ui/i18n`: `formatCurrency()` falls back to `formatNumber`
    semantics when `currency` is omitted.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid`: column-summary formatter (`Sum: 5,000,000`
    instead of `Sum: $5,000,000.00`).
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: header-highlight currency formatter.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`: `ObjectMetricWidget` inferred
    currency now resolves to `undefined` (not `'USD'`) for un-tagged
    fields, so `MetricWidget`'s `isCurrency` heuristic falls through
    to plain number formatting.

- d9c3bae: `RichTextField` now translates its inline hints (`Format: markdown`,
  `Rich text editor (basic)`, `Enter text...`) instead of hardcoding
  English. Adds `fields.richText.*` keys to the en / zh locale packs.

## 5.1.1

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 49b1760: Polish the ConcurrentUpdateDialog and add i18n.
  - Internationalise all dialog strings (title, body, button labels, "your edit" / "current value" headings, audit-trail line) through `useDetailTranslation`. Locale strings added to `@object-ui/i18n` for English and Chinese.
  - Replace the plain dialog header with an amber warning badge + `AlertTriangle` icon to communicate that this is a conflict, not a routine confirmation.
  - Visually differentiate the two value blocks: amber tint for the user's pending edit, sky tint for the server's current value. Both wrap long values cleanly.
  - Surface audit provenance for the racer's write (`updated_at`, plus `updated_by_name`/`updated_by_label` when supplied). Opaque ID-looking `updated_by` tokens are suppressed.
  - Re-prioritise the action buttons: **Reload latest** is now the primary/recommended action (autofocused), **Overwrite anyway** is rendered as a destructive-outline button so the dangerous path requires deliberate intent, and **Cancel** falls back to a ghost variant.

- c0b236f: Platform detail/form polish:
  - **Auto-section grouping**: When an object has no authored `views.form.sections`, the detail page now splits fields into a primary section and a collapsible "More details" section based on a field-type/name heuristic (textarea / markdown / description / notes / remarks). Eliminates the wall-of-fields layout on objects without explicit detail metadata.
  - **FormSection card chrome**: `FormSection` now accepts `showBorder`. Defaults to `true` for titled sections (Card wrapper) and `false` for untitled sections (flat). Same auto-default already applied to `DetailSection`.
  - **Origin breadcrumb**: Navigating from a list/kanban into a record now records the source view; the detail page shows a `← <view label>` back-link above the page header.
  - New i18n key `detail.sectionMoreDetails` (en + zh-CN).

### Patch Changes

- 1976691: Fix the drawer "Open as full page" (maximize) button on the record drawer
  which threw `TypeError: name.indexOf is not a function` and prevented
  navigation to the dedicated detail page.
  - `@object-ui/app-shell` `ObjectView`: pass `objectDef.name` (string) — not
    the whole `objectDef` — into `viewLabel(...)` when computing the
    `originState.from.label` for both drawer-navigate and list-navigate
    flows. Two call sites fixed.
  - `@object-ui/i18n` `useObjectLabel`: harden `stripNamespace` so it
    tolerates non-string inputs and returns an empty string instead of
    throwing, providing a safety net for similar future regressions.

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- cab6a93: **plugin-grid:** column summary footer now formats values using the
  column's type metadata. Currency columns render `Sum: $1,760,000.00`
  instead of bare `Sum: 1,760,000`; percent columns honor `0–1` vs
  `0–100` value ranges; avg uses two fraction digits. `useColumnSummary`
  accepts an optional `fieldMetadata` map (typically `objectSchema.fields`)
  so per-field `type`, `currency`, `defaultCurrency`, `precision` are
  respected.

  **plugin-gantt:** added safe-fallback `useGanttTranslation` hook. All
  hardcoded toolbar `aria-label`s and the `Task Name` / `Start` / `End` /
  `Today` column-header strings now flow through `t('gantt.*')`. A new
  `gantt.*` section is exported from the en/zh/ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/ru/ar
  locales.

  **app-shell:** `ReportView` no longer hardcodes the `Edit` button label
  or the `Loading report…` fallback — they now use `common.edit` and
  `common.loading`.

  **i18n:** added top-level `gantt` section (with English fallbacks in
  non-en/zh locales) and the `common.addToFavorites` /
  `common.removeFromFavorites` keys across all ten built-in locales so
  the `builtInLocales` parity tests pass.

## 5.0.1

## 5.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 8930b15: feat(detail): close the gap between Page-assigned and default record detail pages (Track 1)

  Custom Lightning-style record detail pages (assigned via `assignedPage` /
  `Page` schemas) used to feel meaningfully poorer than the auto-generated
  default detail view. They were missing cross-cutting affordances and
  shipped with English-only tab labels and heavy bordered section cards
  even when the host locale was Chinese. Track 1 closes the visible gap:
  - **app-shell `RecordDetailView`**: the `assignedPage` branch now wears
    the same chrome as the default branch — lifecycle managed-by badge
    and presence avatars in the top-right, `MetadataPanel` debug panel,
    `ActionConfirmDialog` / `ActionParamDialog`, and an auto-appended
    `RecordChatterPanel` at the bottom of the page. Authors opt out of
    the auto-discussion with `assignedPage.disableDiscussion = true`.
  - **plugin-detail `record:details`**: defaults to `inlineEdit: true` so
    fields are click-to-edit just like the default page, and synthesises
    sections with `showBorder: false` by default so a Lightning page
    doesn't double-wrap every block in a heavy Card.
  - **components `page:tabs` / `page:accordion`**: well-known English
    labels (Details / Related / Activity / History / Notes / Files /
    Tasks / Events / Attachments / Chatter / Discussion / Comments /
    Overview / Summary) auto-translate to Chinese (`zh-CN` / `zh-TW`)
    via a built-in dictionary keyed off `document.documentElement.lang`.
    Authors supplying explicit localised labels (string or
    `{ default, zh-CN, ... }`) are not affected.
  - **i18n provider**: applies the initial language to
    `document.documentElement.lang` on mount (i18next does not fire
    `languageChanged` for the bootstrap language), so locale-aware
    renderers downstream see the right value from the first render.

## 4.8.0

## 4.6.0

## 4.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 22fa558: Clean up pre-existing TypeScript errors in `plugin-list` and tighten i18n:
  - Switch grouping-editor labels to `t(key, { defaultValue })` option form so i18next's strict types accept the literal fallback.
  - Add the missing `list.addGroup` / `list.collapsedByDefault` / `list.removeGroup` keys to en + zh locale bundles.
  - Drop the dead `currentView === 'list'` branch in `ListView` (local `ViewType` union has `'grid'`, never `'list'`).
  - Widen `UserFilters.resolveFields` `translateOptions` parameter from a generic `<T>` to the concrete option shape so it matches the `useObjectLabel` hook's signature.

## 4.4.0

## 4.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 5f4ac6e: fix(i18n): add notifications + organizations namespaces to all 8 non-en/zh locales (ar/de/es/fr/ja/ko/pt/ru) to restore top-level key parity. Resolves the long-standing i18n.test.ts locale-parity failure.

## 4.3.0

### Patch Changes

- f196cf4: feat(plugin-report): popup picker for groupings + section-aware test ids

  The matrix/summary "Group by" (rows) and "Columns axis" (cols) sections now
  share the same searchable popup picker as the columns section, with a
  commit-on-select single-pick mode wired through `FieldPickerDialog`.
  - Per-row field buttons display the human-readable field label and open a
    dialog scoped to swap that single field (already-used fields filtered out)
  - "Add grouping" trigger uses the same dialog
  - `GroupingsBuilder` accepts a `testIdPrefix` prop; ReportConfigPanel passes
    `rows-grouping` and `cols-grouping` so both instances no longer share the
    ambiguous `grouping-field-0` testid
  - Bigger row spacing (h-7 / text-xs) — the old `text-[10px]` was unreadable

  `FieldPickerDialog` gains:
  - `commitOnSelect`: hides the Confirm/Cancel footer; clicking a row commits
    - closes immediately (intended for `singleSelect` flows)
  - `trigger`: custom trigger element override (used by the per-row field button)

- ee1cc96: feat(plugin-report): joined-report block editor

  `type: 'joined'` reports were a black hole in the editor — the type
  selector exposed them but no UI knew how to edit the `blocks` array,
  so users could neither create nor modify joined reports without
  hand-editing JSON.

  This change adds a `Blocks` section to the report editor, visible only
  when `type === 'joined'`. Each block renders as a collapsible card with
  its own name (required + unique-validated), label, description, block
  type, object override, and reuses the existing `ColumnsEditor`,
  `GroupingsBuilder`, `SpecFilterAdapter`, and `ChartConfig` builders so
  every block behaves like a mini standalone report — matching the
  runtime contract of `JoinedReportRenderer`.

  Block-level validation is surfaced in the main `ValidationBanner`:
  empty blocks array, missing or duplicate block names, and blocks
  without columns all become editor-time errors so saves stay safe.

  The non-joined sections (Columns / Rows / Columns axis / Filters /
  Chart) are hidden when `type === 'joined'` since they live per-block
  in the spec.

  New exports from `@object-ui/plugin-report`:
  - `JoinedBlocksEditor` — standalone component for embedding the
    block editor anywhere.
  - `validateJoinedBlocks` — pure helper returning translated
    problem strings, suitable for custom validation banners.
  - `ColumnsEditor`, `GroupingsBuilder`, `ChartConfig`,
    `SpecFilterAdapter`, `normalizeColumns` are now exported so
    downstream consumers can build their own report-editor surfaces.

  i18n: added `report.editor.blocks*` / `report.editor.addBlock` /
  `report.editor.removeBlock` / `report.editor.blockName*` /
  `report.editor.blockLabel*` / `report.editor.blockDescription*` /
  `report.editor.validationJoinedNeedsBlocks` /
  `report.editor.validationBlockNameRequired` /
  `report.editor.validationBlockNameDuplicate` /
  `report.editor.validationBlockNeedsColumns` to en + zh.

- 0b032be: feat(plugin-report): replace inline column picker with a popup field picker

  The columns section now opens a Dialog-based multi-select picker (`FieldPickerDialog`)
  instead of rendering the unselected field list inline. The popup supports search,
  batched multi-selection (commit several fields in one click), per-field type badges,
  cancel-discards-pending semantics, and is fully i18n'd. Also fixes a latent
  `ReferenceError: normalizeColumns is not defined` that crashed the editor whenever
  the chart section was expanded.

- 115d36a: i18n: native translations for the report editor (`report.editor.*`) in 8 locales — ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru. Previously these locales had the English placeholder strings copy-pasted from `en.ts` and the newer `blocks*`, `addCondition`, `opContains`, `formatCurrency` etc. keys were missing entirely (so the report editor surfaced raw key names in those languages). All locales now carry the full key set with locale-appropriate copy.
- 4e7bc1b: **Report editor panel overhaul**

  The report configuration panel is now safe to open on any spec-shape `Report` and only exposes fields that are actually persisted by `@objectstack/spec`.

  `@object-ui/plugin-report`:
  - Add a bidirectional `SpecFilterAdapter` so `ReportConfigPanel` can edit
    spec `FilterCondition` filters (`{field: value}`, `{field: {$op: value}}`,
    top-level `$and`/`$or`). Complex / nested filters fall back to a
    read-only banner and are preserved verbatim on save.
  - Drop sections that never round-tripped through the spec
    (`conditionalFormatting`, `sections`, `export`, `schedule`, `appearance`)
    and their helper components.
  - Add type-driven section visibility: `tabular` shows Columns/Filters,
    `summary` adds Rows + Chart, `matrix` adds Rows + Columns axis + Chart.
  - New `GroupingsBuilder` covers `groupingsDown`/`groupingsAcross` with
    `sortOrder` and date-aware `dateGranularity` controls.
  - New `ColumnsEditor` lets users reorder picked columns, override labels,
    set aggregates and choose a display format.
  - Chart subset now mirrors the spec: chart `title`, `showLegend`,
    `showDataLabels`, plus `funnel` (scatter removed).
  - Validation banner highlights missing `objectName` and missing
    rows/columns for `matrix`/`summary` reports.
  - All editor labels and hints are i18n-driven (`report.editor.*`).
  - 18 new unit tests cover the filter adapter round-trip.

  `@object-ui/components`:
  - `FilterBuilder` now guards against malformed external `value` props.
    Previously a spec-shape filter (`{is_active: true}`) would crash the
    component on first render; the builder now falls back to an empty
    AND group whenever `value` is not a valid `FilterGroup`.

  `@object-ui/i18n`:
  - Add `report.editor.*` strings to `en` and `zh`.

- 8442c05: Improve report editor panel usability based on real-user browser testing:
  - **Wider config panel** — the report editor now defaults to a `--config-panel-width`
    of 440px (up from 280px), driven by a new optional `style` prop on
    `ConfigPanelRenderer`. Long field labels, report titles, type labels, and filter
    rows no longer truncate to "Account Na" / "kup" / "ct" / 1-character widths.
  - **Disambiguated "Columns" sections** — for `summary` and `matrix` reports the
    measure list is now labelled **"Values / 度量"** (pivot-style vocabulary) instead
    of "Columns", which previously clashed with the matrix's pivot column axis
    (also called "Columns / 列"). The two sections used to be indistinguishable.
    New i18n key `report.editor.values` / `valuesHint` is shipped for all 10
    locales (en, zh, ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru).
  - **Reordered sections for matrix/summary** — the editor now surfaces _Rows_
    and _Columns_ (the pivot axes) **before** _Values_, mirroring how a business
    user thinks about a pivot table.
  - **Per-row aggregate/format headers** — each column row in `ColumnsEditor` now
    shows small "Aggregate" / "Format" labels above the respective selects, and
    the row uses a 2-line layout so the label input has its own line. The cramped
    3-dropdowns-side-by-side layout at 10px font is gone.
  - **Searchable field picker** — the "Add columns" list now has a search box,
    a `filtered / total` counter, an empty-state message, and a scrollable bordered
    container. New i18n keys: `report.editor.searchFields`,
    `report.editor.noMatchingFields`.

### Patch Changes

- eb738bd: fix(i18n): add missing top-level `report` key to ar/de/es/fr/ja/ko/pt/ru locales

  The i18n parity test (`all locales have the same top-level keys`) was failing
  because the `report` key existed only in `en` and `zh`. The other built-in
  locales now include the same `report` block (English fallback strings) so the
  CI parity check passes again.

- 650392e: MatrixRenderer now displays i18n-translated labels for picklist (`select` / `status`) groupings instead of raw values (e.g. `Best Case` / `Commit` / `Pipeline` instead of `best_case` / `commit` / `pipeline`). Field labels in the corner cell, row/column total labels, and the `(Empty)` / `(All)` placeholders are also fully translated. Adds `report.*` keys to `en` and `zh` locale bundles.
- 84b4bf1: Summary reports now render i18n-translated labels in the chart axis, chart series legend, and totals strip. `buildChartData` accepts a new `labels` parameter so callers (currently `SpecReportGrid`) can supply field/column/aggregate/value resolvers. Replaces raw column keys (e.g. `Count of case_number`) and raw picklist values (e.g. `closed`, `in_progress`) with their translated display labels (e.g. `案例编号 · 计数`, `已关闭`, `处理中`). Adds `report.totals` locale key.

### Patch Changes

- 1909bc3: Add `transformSpecTranslations` / `isSpecTranslationData` helpers to
  `@object-ui/i18n` so apps no longer need to maintain their own copy of the
  `@objectstack/spec` `TranslationData` → flat namespace transform.

  The new transform preserves **every** `_`-prefixed object scope by
  convention (`_views`, `_actions`, `_sections`, `_notifications`, `_errors`,
  `_options`, plus anything added in future spec versions), which fixes a
  class of silent-failure regressions where new spec scopes were dropped
  during transformation — leaving e.g. list-view labels to fall back to the
  untranslated source string.

  `@object-ui/console`'s `loadLanguage.ts` is rewritten to delegate to the
  shared helper.

### Patch Changes

- 3d58eaa: fix(auth,app-shell): hide Log out menu item when auth is disabled (guest/preview mode)

  When the console runs against a server with `discovery.services.auth.enabled === false`
  (or in preview mode), `AuthProvider` hardcodes `isAuthenticated: true` and the mock
  `signOut()` has no real backend. Previously, clicking "Log out" in the user menu had
  no visible effect — the user/session were nulled but the UI stayed authenticated.

  Changes:
  - **`@object-ui/auth`** — added `isAuthEnabled: boolean` to `AuthContextValue`
    (`true` only when real auth is in use, `false` for guest/preview modes).
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `AppHeader` and `AppSidebar` now hide the "Log out"
    menu item entirely when `!isAuthEnabled`, so users aren't presented with an action
    that can't actually do anything. Also fixed two missed i18n strings in
    `AppSidebar` ("Settings", "Log out").
  - **`@object-ui/i18n`** — added `user.{profile,settings,logout}` namespace to all
    10 built-in locales (en/zh translated; ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/ru/ar fall back to
    English pending native translation).

## 4.0.7

### Patch Changes

- fd15918: Comprehensive i18n refactor + CI test fix.

  **i18n (`@object-ui/i18n`)**
  - Added ~130 new keys under 12 new top-level namespaces: `layout`, `search`,
    `empty`, `renderer`, `actionDialog`, `rowAction`, `navigationSync`,
    `objectActions`, `objectViewActions`, `dashboardActions`, `recordDetail`,
    `cellRender`, plus `grid.{empty,yes,no,systemFields,openMenu}`.
  - Mirrored all new top-level namespaces to all 10 built-in locales
    (en, zh, ja, ko, de, fr, es, pt, ru, ar) to maintain key parity required
    by the locale-structure test. Non-en/zh locales seed with English values
    and rely on `fallbackLng: 'en'` until human translation lands.

  **App shell (`@object-ui/app-shell`)** — replaced hardcoded English in 14
  files with `useObjectTranslation`:
  - Layout: `AppSidebar`, `ActivityFeed` (locale-aware relative time),
    `MetadataInspector`.
  - Views: `SearchResultsPage`, `ActionParamDialog`, `RecordFormPage`,
    `RecordDetailView`, `PageView`, `DashboardView` (PDF / forecast toasts),
    `ReportView`, `ObjectView` (rename / delete view toasts).
  - Console: `AppContent` (no-apps empty state).
  - Components: `PageRenderer`, `FormRenderer`, `DashboardRenderer`.
  - Hooks: `useNavigationSync` (16 toasts incl. Undo label),
    `useObjectActions` (delete confirm + success / failure toasts).

  **Plugin grid (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**
  - `ObjectGrid` record-detail panel now translates Empty / Yes / No / System
    via the existing `useGridTranslation` safe-fallback wrapper.
  - `RowActionMenu` adopts a local safe-fallback i18n wrapper for
    `Open menu` / `Edit` / `Delete`, preserving standalone-usage guarantees.

  **CLI test fix (`@object-ui/cli`)**
  - `cli-bin.test.ts` auto-builds the package on first run when `dist/cli.js`
    is missing, instead of throwing. This unbreaks `pnpm test:coverage` in CI
    (root vitest run does not honor turbo's `^build` deps) and removes the
    manual `pnpm --filter @object-ui/cli build` requirement for local dev.

## 4.0.5

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
