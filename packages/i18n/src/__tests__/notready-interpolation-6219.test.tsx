/**
 * A bare `useObjectTranslation()` fills its inline default's `{{holes}}` even
 * with no `I18nProvider` mounted — objectui#6219.
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why it has to render
 *
 * react-i18next's not-ready `t` (`notReadyT`, used when no i18next instance is
 * initialised) returns `options.defaultValue` VERBATIM. So an inline default
 * written `'Deleted {{count}} rows'` used to reach the user with the braces
 * intact — 68 of them across 24 files, on any host that embeds an ObjectUI
 * component without a provider, which is the configuration
 * `createSafeTranslation` exists for (objectui#3865).
 *
 * ⚠️ **A test that mounts `I18nProvider` can never see that defect.** With a
 * provider, i18next is ready, the pack value wins and the inline default never
 * renders at all — such an assertion is true before and after the fix. Every
 * case below that is doing the actual work therefore renders PROVIDER-LESS and
 * reads `textContent` off the DOM, rather than inspecting the return value of a
 * `t` this file called itself.
 *
 * ## Which cases would still pass on a revert, and why they are here
 *
 * Stated rather than left to be rediscovered:
 *
 *   - `the positive control` — by construction. It proves the probe really is
 *     on the not-ready path (no global instance, raw key for an unknown key).
 *     Green either way is what makes it a control.
 *   - `a pre-interpolated template literal is left exactly as written` — green
 *     either way, deliberately. It is the ⭐ corollary from objectui#4905: at a
 *     bare `useObjectTranslation()` the template-literal form is the CORRECT
 *     spelling, and this fix must not have made it wrong. Its job is to fail if
 *     someone later "tidies" these defaults into `{{hole}}` form or teaches the
 *     interpolator to touch text with no holes.
 *   - `an i18next-only spelling is still not resolved here` — green either way.
 *     objectui#3512 ruled against teaching the fallback i18next's other
 *     dialects; this fix widens which BINDINGS interpolate, never which
 *     SPELLINGS resolve, and this case is what holds that line.
 *   - `with a provider mounted, the pack value still wins` — green either way.
 *     A must-not-break, and the structural half of "never interpolate twice".
 *
 * Everything under `THE PIN` fails on a revert.
