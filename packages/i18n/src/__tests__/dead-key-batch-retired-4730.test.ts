/**
 * Twenty-five confirmed-dead locale keys are retired from all ten packs
 * (objectui#4730's key-level trim round; `calendar.agenda` closes objectui#5783).
 *
 * ## Why this pin is NEGATIVE, and why it is needed at all
 *
 * Every i18n gate in this repo runs **call site -> key**, never key -> call site
 * (objectui#4145's mechanism, restated by #4392, #4730, #5504 and #6310):
 *
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` asks whether each call site's key
 *     resolves in `en`. A key with no call site is never visited.
 *   - `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` compares the ten packs' key SETS to each
 *     other. One dead key present in all ten is exactly what it wants.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` only fires when an `en` value CHANGES.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs` IS the reverse direction, and it is
 *     report-only by design and wired into no workflow (objectui#4658).
 *
 * So any retired row can return to all ten packs with every gate green. This
 * file is the only thing watching that direction for this batch.
 *
 * ## The three retirement shapes in this batch
 *
 * 1. **Superseded twin vocabularies.** `cellRender.*` and `rowAction.*` were
 *    whole namespaces duplicating a `grid.*` vocabulary that won: the live
 *    `RowActionMenu.tsx` is fully i18n-wired and reads `grid.openMenu` /
 *    `grid.edit` / `grid.delete`, and `ObjectGrid.tsx` reads `grid.empty` /
 *    `grid.yes` / `grid.no` / `grid.systemFields`. The twins had no reader.
 *    {@link SUPERSEDING_TWINS} pins the winners so this file cannot go green by
 *    deleting both halves.
 * 2. **Labels that outlived their control.** `calendar.agenda` labelled a view
 *    mode objectui#5740 retired from `CalendarViewMode` (now
 *    `'month' | 'week' | 'day'`); `home.quickActions.createApp*`,
 *    `layout.systemNav.createApp`, `actionDialog.defaultActionTitle` /
 *    `.ok` and `grid.bulk.selectPlaceholder` sit in namespaces whose consumers
 *    are live and i18n-wired but demonstrably read other siblings.
 * 3. **Surfaces that left the product.** `map.*` is the strongest form:
 *    `@object-ui/plugin-map` declares no `@object-ui/i18n` dependency and
 *    contains no `t()` call at all, so it cannot consume a locale string.
 *    `home.stats.*` and `recordDetail.viewersTooltip` name surfaces nothing
 *    renders.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT claim
 *
 * It does not claim the reverse sweep's CONFIRMED tier is safe to bulk-delete.
 * Five keys that the sweep reported CONFIRMED-dead in this very round are LIVE
 * and were pulled back out of the batch — see {@link BLIND_SPOT_LIVE} below,
 * which is the most load-bearing assertion in this file.

/**
 * ⚠️ The most load-bearing list in this file.
 *
 * These keys were reported CONFIRMED-dead by `check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs` in the
 * same run that produced {@link RETIRED} — and they are LIVE. They were pulled
 * out of the batch after reading their consumer.
 *
 * `packages/app-shell/src/chrome/LoadingScreen.tsx` is bootstrap-critical UI: it
 * must render before i18n loads (that is exactly when the server is
 * unreachable), so it deliberately does NOT call `useObjectTranslation`. Instead
 * it imports the packs directly (`import { en as enLocale, builtInLocales } from
 * '@object-ui/i18n'`) and reads them as PLAIN OBJECT PROPERTIES:
 * `strings.loadingSteps.connecting`, `strings.error.connectionFailed`, and so on.
 *
 * That consumer is invisible to BOTH legs of the sweep's evidence standard:
 *
 *   - the AST pass only classifies `t()` / `tt()` calls, and there is no call;
 *   - the text safety net greps the FULL dotted key, and the full dotted key is
 *     never spelled — the namespace segment is bound to a local variable, so the
 *     source reads `strings.loadingSteps.connecting`, never
 *     `console.loadingSteps.connecting`.
 *
 * A reverse sweep therefore reports this whole family as CONFIRMED dead, at the
 * strongest tier, with no hint that anything was missed. Deleting it ships a
 * blank splash screen in ten locales on exactly the server-down boot the screen
 * exists to explain. Pinned by name so the next sweep round cannot repeat it.
