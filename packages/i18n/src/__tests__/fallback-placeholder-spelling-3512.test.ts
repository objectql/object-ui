/**
 * Every placeholder a provider-less fallback will ever meet is spelled the one
 * way that fallback can resolve — objectui#3512.
 *
 * ## The fork this closes, and the direction it is closed in
 *
 * `createSafeTranslation`'s `fallbackT` interpolates with an EXACT literal
 * needle (`useSafeTranslation.ts`: ``value.split(`{{${k}}}`).join(String(v))``),
 * so it recognises `{{name}}` and nothing else. i18next — which serves the
 * SAME strings whenever an `I18nProvider` is mounted — additionally recognises
 * `{{ name }}` (whitespace inside the braces), `{{count, number}}` (a format
 * spec), `{{- name}}` (the unescape prefix) and `$t(otherKey)` (nesting).
 * Measured on a real i18next 26.3.6 instance configured the way `createI18n`
 * configures it (`interpolation: { escapeValue: false }`), those four render
 * correctly through the provider and leak literal braces without one.
 *
 * The card left two directions open. The maintainer's objectui#4135 ruling
 * settled it: `{{x}}` is EXCLUSIVELY i18next-bound copy, `{x}` is a hole filled
 * downstream of `t()`. So the answer is not to teach the fallback three more
 * dialects (a second interpolator to keep in step with i18next forever), it is
 * to hold the copy to the one spelling both paths agree on. Declared =
 * enforced: the divergence stays unreachable by construction instead of by
 * luck. The fallback's behaviour is deliberately NOT changed by this file.
 *
 * ## The false positives this must not produce
 *
 * Two classes, both named on the card and by three triage rounds:
 *
 *   - **Single braces.** `{shown}` / `{total}` in `gantt.quickFilter.resultSummary`
 *     is a downstream hole by design — its call site does a literal
 *     `.replace('{shown}', …)`. Under #4135 that is the CORRECT spelling for a
 *     non-i18next hole, so flagging it would invert the ruling. The rule below
 *     only ever inspects the inside of a `{{…}}` pair, so single braces are
 *     structurally out of range, and the liveness cases pin real single-brace
 *     rows staying green.
 *   - **JSX object literals.** `style={{ opacity: 0 }}`, `context={{ org }}` —
 *     `{{` in TSX that is syntax, not copy. Every earlier sweep of this card hit
 *     them, because a bare source grep cannot tell them from a spaced
 *     placeholder. This gate never greps source text for `{{`: it reads only
 *     STRING VALUES reached through a copy table's own data structure, and a JSX
 *     brace is not inside a string literal. The class is excluded by where the
 *     scanner looks, not by an allow-list that could rot.
 *
 * ## The copy sources under the gate, and why exactly these
 *
 * The subject is "text a literal-needle interpolator can be asked to render".
 * Three surfaces, measured on this tree:
 *
 *   1. **The ten locale packs** (`builtInLocales`, 28k+ string leaves). Imported
 *      as data. They are upstream of surface 2 — `defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack.test.ts`
 *      (objectui#4401) and objectui#3440 pin defaults rows byte-identical to
 *      their `en` row — so a spaced placeholder authored in a pack lands in a
 *      defaults table by way of a gate that is doing its job. Note the existing
 *      `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` "placeholders match en" case cannot see
 *      this: its `\{\{\w+\}\}` shape regex simply does not match `{{ name }}`,
 *      so a spelling introduced in `en` AND its nine translations at once is
 *      shape-equal, hence green. That case compares packs to each other; this
 *      one judges a pack against the fallback's grammar in absolute terms.
 *   2. **The `createSafeTranslation` defaults tables** — 31 of them, 762 string
 *      rows, DISCOVERED rather than listed (below), so a new table is gated the
 *      day it is written.
 *   3. **The three hand-rolled sibling tables** whose packages re-implemented
 *      the same literal needle instead of taking the factory
 *      (`GANTT_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`, `IMPORT_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`,
 *      `TIMELINE_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`; each file states its own reason for not
 *      using the factory). They are a registry, and a completeness case pins the
 *      set of files carrying that needle, so a fourth copy of the interpolator
 *      cannot quietly land outside the gate.
 *
 * Two neighbours were measured and deliberately left out:
 *
 *   - **Inline `t(key, { defaultValue })`.** `fallbackT` does read it (the
 *     objectui#3865 chain step), and 0 of them violate the rule today. Left out
 *     because it is a call-site OPTION rather than a copy table — the two
 *     surfaces this card was scoped to — and because `check:i18n-keys`'
 *     `default-value-drift` class already pins 906 of its 909 literal inline
 *     defaults byte-identical to their `en` row, which surface 1 gates. The
 *     residual is those 3 "not comparable" plus 62 computed ones: recorded as a
 *     coverage boundary, and filed, rather than silently assumed covered.
 *   - **`ConcurrentUpdateDialog.tsx`'s `.split('{{field}}')`.** A hard-coded
 *     needle CONSUMING a pack value, not a table of its own — surface 1 covers
 *     the value it splits.
 *
 * ## Division of labour with the three existing i18n gates
 *
 * All four read the same packs, and each is blind to what this one owns:
 *
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` — its `holesOf()` deliberately
 *     reads THROUGH all four dialects when extracting a hole's NAME (`{{n, number}}`
 *     yields `n`, `{{- html}}` yields `html`, `{{user.name}}` yields `user`), so
 *     that an argument-parity verdict survives one appearing. It tolerates; it
 *     never rejects — and its own comment records the measurement this file turns
 *     into a rule: "all 84 distinct holes in `en` are bare names". This gate is
 *     the enforcement half of that sentence.
 *   - `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` — pack vs pack, and RELATIVE: its shape
 *     regex is `\{\{\w+\}\}`, which does not match `{{ name }}` at all. A
 *     spelling introduced in `en` and its nine translations together is
 *     shape-equal in that comparison, hence green. This file judges a pack
 *     against the fallback's grammar in ABSOLUTE terms, which is the only way
 *     that case is reachable.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` — fires on an `en` value CHANGING. A
 *     value authored with a spaced placeholder on day one never changes, so it
 *     is invisible there by construction.
 *
 * ## Why this file lives in `@object-ui/i18n` when two of its surfaces do not
 *
 * `defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack.test.ts` had to move to `app-shell` because it
 * IMPORTS three plugin maps, and every one of those packages depends on this
 * one — importing them back inverts the dependency. This file imports nothing
 * outside its own package: it READS the source files as text and parses them,
 * which is not a module dependency in either direction (same mechanism as
 * `forwardref-props-annotation.guard.test.ts`). So the rule can live beside the
 * fallback whose grammar it is enforcing, which is where the next person to
 * touch `useSafeTranslation.ts` will look.
 *
 * ## Direction of the reverse verification, predicted before running (#4118)
 *
 * Straight red, not the inverted or count-shaped variants: the rule is an
 * absolute predicate over values, with no `??` chain and no verdict count for a
 * mutation to empty out. Injecting `{{ name }}` (spaced), `{{count, number}}`
 * (format spec) or `$t(other)` (nesting) into ONE real row of ONE real table
 * must turn exactly the case that owns that surface red, naming the file and the
 * key — and leave the liveness and single-brace cases green, because the
 * injected row is one row. Verified all three ways on this tree, plus the two
 * false-positive controls staying green; recorded on the PR.
