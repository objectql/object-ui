/**
 * `report.editor.*` is retired down to ONE key, and must stay that way
 * (objectui#4145).
 *
 * ## What was removed and why
 *
 * The namespace held 106 keys in each of the ten packs — ~1060 translated
 * strings — labelling the hand-rolled report editor form: field labels, chart
 * type options, filter operators, validation messages, a field picker. That
 * form no longer exists. `ReportConfigPanel`'s body is `ReportDefaultInspector`,
 * a spec-driven inspector whose labels come from the report spec's own metadata
 * rather than from this namespace.
 *
 * Until objectui#4137 the namespace had exactly ONE live reader, and it was a
 * defect: the panel borrowed `report.editor.title` — the label of the report's
 * Title *field* — to name itself, so the panel was headed "Title" and its
 * `role="complementary"` landmark announced "Title" (objectui#4118). Moving that
 * slot onto a purpose-built `report.editor.panelTitle` fixed the defect and left
 * the other 105 keys with no reader anywhere: no `t()` call site, no dynamic
 * `t(`report.editor.${…}`)` form, no JSON or MDX reference. They were retired.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is NEGATIVE, and why it is needed at all
 *
 * Every i18n gate in this repo runs **call site → key**, never key → call site:
 *
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` asks whether each call site's key
 *     resolves in `en`. A key with no call site is never visited.
 *   - `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` compares the ten packs' key SETS to each
 *     other. 105 dead keys present in all ten packs is exactly what it wants.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` only fires when an `en` value CHANGES.
 *     These values were static.
 *
 * So the packs can accumulate dead namespaces indefinitely with every gate
 * green — that is how this one survived, and it is why the guard has to be
 * written down by name rather than derived. Restoring any retired key to any
 * pack must go red here.
 *
 * Reverse-verified: reviving a single retired key in a single pack turns TWO
 * independent gates red — this pin (naming the pack and the key) and
 * `all-locales-key-parity`'s "en defines every key the other packs define".
