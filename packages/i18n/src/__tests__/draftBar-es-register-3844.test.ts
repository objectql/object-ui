/**
 * `preview.draftBar` speaks ONE second person in `es` — usted (objectui#3844).
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `DraftPreviewBar` renders two mutually exclusive sentences in the same strip
 * of the same banner: `message` when there are unpublished changes,
 * `messageClean` when there are none. In `es` the two disagreed on register —
 * `message` was tú (`estás viendo`, `publiques`) while `messageClean` (`ve`)
 * and `sampleDataBody` (`Está`, `su`, `Publíquela`) were usted. A Spanish user
 * who pressed Publish watched the banner switch from tú to usted: same
 * component, same position, same session.
 *
 * ## Why usted is the answer here (the ruling, not a preference)
 *
 * Three independent readings, all measured rather than guessed:
 *
 *   1. **Pack default.** The `es` pack censuses 102 usted markers against 30
 *      tú. tú is the marked exception, concentrated in auth sign-in/sign-up,
 *      the report editor and organizations — neighbourhoods objectui#3546
 *      slice two deliberately ruled informal. `preview` is not one of them.
 *   2. **Same banner, same voice.** The other two strings of this very object
 *      (`messageClean`, `sampleDataBody`) were already usted, and so is
 *      `publishCta`. Aligning the one outlier is a strictly smaller change
 *      than re-voicing the namespace, and it is the change that removes the
 *      user-visible switch.
 *   3. **The sister banner.** objectui#3546 slice five gave the 19 new
 *      `preview.unpublishedBar.*` / `preview.history.*` keys usted, on the
 *      strength of `home.pendingDrafts.published` ("¡Publicado! Sus cambios
 *      están activos."), the structural twin of
 *      `preview.unpublishedBar.published`. Leaving `draftBar.message` tú would
 *      have made the older banner disagree with its freshly-translated sister.
 *
 * Direction B (re-voicing all of `preview` to tú) was rejected: it is a much
 * larger change and would collide with the adjacent `marketplace.*` (9:0
 * usted) and `console.ai.*`.
 *
 * ## What this file deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * **No morphological register detection.** objectui#3844 evaluated a gate that
 * checks "one register per namespace" and argued it down. Recognising usted vs
 * tú needs real morphology, and token matching demonstrably cannot: in this
 * very pack the token `revisa` is **usted** in `console.ai.empty.build`
 * (es.ts:1365, "…y usted revisa y publica.", present indicative with an
 * explicit `usted`) and **tú** in `auth.forgotPassword.successTitle`
 * (es.ts:1918, "Revisa tu correo electrónico", imperative). Same eight
 * letters, opposite registers, and no regex over the string can tell them
 * apart. The reverse error is just as easy: third-person and impersonal forms
 * read as usted markers — a crude `puede|su|…` scan over `approvalsInbox`
 * returns five "usted" hits that are all about *el solicitante* or are
 * impersonal ("No se puede determinar la identidad"), in a namespace whose
 * second-person address is in fact uniformly tú (nine strings). objectui#3844
 * recorded this hazard as "the census regex miscounted `Revisa`"; the
 * measurement above is the precise version — the miscount is the usted
 * indicative at :1365, not an imperative. Worse, the boundary such a gate
 * would police — which neighbourhood is informal — is human judgement (slice
 * two's "same rule, different answer" precedent), so a gate could only ever
 * check consistency *within* a boundary it cannot draw.
 * This file therefore pins **these four literal values, byte for byte**, and
 * generalises to nothing. The retired-spelling checks below are exact
 * substrings lifted from the pre-fix value of this one key — the same
 * technique as `viewReadonlyTooltip-semantics-3625.test.ts` — not a register
 * rule in disguise.
 *
 * Scope note: `preview.empty.notReadyDescription` (es.ts:3286, `Revisa`) is
 * still tú and is left that way here, because re-voicing the namespace is the
 * rejected direction B and objectui#3844's ruling is this banner only. It is
 * **not** harmless, and this file does not pin it: `PreviewDraftEmptyState`
 * (`AppContent.tsx`, returned while `previewDrafts` and the app is not yet
 * staged) renders in the content area *underneath* `DraftPreviewBar`
 * (`ConsoleLayout.tsx`), so those two are on screen at the SAME time — usted in
 * the bar, tú in the pane below it. That is sharper than objectui#3844's own
 * sequential switch and is filed separately as objectui#3875. After this change
 * the `preview` namespace is 23 usted to that 1 tú.
 *
 * Related: objectui#3546 (slice five measured this while ruling es register),
 * objectui#3810 / objectui#3582 / objectui#3625 (the other value-domain blind
 * spots), objectui#3530 (call-site gate), objectui#3650 (en-drift gate). None
 * of the three i18n gates can see this defect: the call-site gate only asks
 * whether a key exists in `en`, `all-locales-key-parity` compares key names
 * and placeholder shapes and never reads values, and the en-drift gate only
 * fires when an `en` value moves — these two `en` values never moved.
