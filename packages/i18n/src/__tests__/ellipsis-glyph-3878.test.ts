/**
 * objectui#3878 — the ten packs wrote the ellipsis two ways at once. `en` ended
 * 33 values with three ASCII full stops (`Loading...`) and 110 with the
 * typographic ellipsis U+2026 (`Loading…`), and the nine translation packs
 * copied `en` value by value, so the split propagated rather than being a
 * translation habit.
 *
 * It is **same-screen visible**, which is why it is a defect and not a taste:
 * `console.ai.askAnything` (`Ask anything...`) sits in the AI panel beside
 * sibling values that already used `…`, and `common.loading` (`Loading...`)
 * renders on the same dashboard as `dashboard.loading` (`Loading…`).
 *
 * ## The ruling
 *
 * Converge on **U+2026 `…`**, per the maintainer-authorized consistency pass
 * registered on objectstack#6015 (2026-08-09): typographic ellipsis for
 * user-facing copy. `…` was already the 110:33 majority in `en` and the
 * typographically correct form, so the minority moved.
 *
 * ## Why the invariant is "no ASCII `...` in ANY value of ANY pack"
 *
 * The card asked for "a trailing ASCII `...` in an `en` value errors". The scan
 * below is deliberately wider on both axes, because the census taken at landing
 * showed the narrow version would have shipped with holes in it:
 *
 *   - **Not trailing-only.** `collaboration.commentPlaceholder` is
 *     `Add a comment… (use @ to mention)` — the ellipsis is mid-sentence, and
 *     all nine packs already wrote it as `…` while `en` alone wrote `...`. A
 *     trailing-only rule cannot see that value at all, and it renders in the
 *     same composer as `collaboration.replyingTo`, which the same pass moved.
 *   - **Not en-only.** `list.loading` was the mirror image: `en` already said
 *     `Carregando…`-style `…` while all nine packs still said `...`. `en` never
 *     changed, so `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` had no event to fire on and the nine
 *     were free to sit there. An `en`-only rule is blind to exactly this shape.
 *
 * The wider form also needs no per-key list to maintain: a new value arriving
 * with a typewriter ellipsis fails by key name without anyone editing this file.
 * That is the same reasoning, and the same final shape, as
 * `de-quote-pairing-3876.test.ts`, whose per-key list became "no U+0022 in the
 * `de` pack at all" once the last straight quotes were gone.
 *
 * ## Why the three script gates cannot see any of this
 *
 * `all-locales-key-parity` compares key sets and placeholder shapes,
 * `check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` asks only whether a key resolves, and
 * `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` fires on an **`en` value change** — these values were
 * split from the day they landed, so for most of them no drift event ever
 * existed. All three are value-blind by design, which is why the convention has
 * to be pinned in a test.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT cover, deliberately
 *
 * The per-package **no-provider fallback tables** hold their own English copies
 * of some of these keys (`packages/collaboration/src/useCollaborationTranslation.ts`,
 * `packages/fields/src/widgets/useFieldTranslation.ts`,
 * `packages/plugin-detail/src/useDetailTranslation.ts` and others), and they
 * still spell the ellipsis in ASCII. Those copies render only when no
 * `LocalizationProvider` is mounted; converging them is a separate surface with
 * its own in-flight owners, filed separately rather than smuggled in here. This
 * scan is scoped to the ten packs and says so, so the next reader does not read
 * its green as a claim about those tables.

/**
 * objectui#5972 — the merged `Loading…` group, pinned for PER-LANGUAGE uniformity.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in the #3878 file
 *
 * #3878 is what created the group. Before it, `Loading…` (U+2026) named 8 keys
 * and `Loading...` (ASCII) named 2 more; the glyph convergence merged them into
 * one 10-key group whose `en` value is byte-identically `Loading…`. Nobody
 * re-measured the wording afterwards, and the merged group turned out to be
 * rendered four different ways in `de`, two in `ko` and two in `ar` — a split
 * that only becomes visible once the two glyph groups are one group, which is
 * exactly why the pin belongs beside the pass that merged them.
 *
 * This block adds a rule; it does not touch #3878's. The glyph invariant above
 * ("no ASCII `...` in any value of any pack") still stands on its own, and
 * nothing here weakens it: every value this pass moved keeps its U+2026.
 *
 * ## The ruling
 *
 * Triage, concentrated round 2026-08-25: converge each language pack to ONE
 * rendering per language across the merged group, chosen by that pack's
 * majority / most-idiomatic form. Translation copy only — no key is added or
 * removed and no `en` value moves, so no contract changes and
 * `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` has no event to fire on.
 *
 *   - **de** → `Wird geladen…` (was 6, plus `Laden…` ×2, `Lade…` ×1, `Lädt…` ×1).
 *     The passive is also the de pack's dominant register for in-flight states
 *     generally: 37 values whose `en` is a bare gerund render as `Wird …`.
 *   - **ko** → `로딩 중…` (was 6, plus `불러오는 중…` ×4). Majority, and it agrees
 *     with the pack's own pattern: `불러오는 중` is what `ko` uses when the string
 *     names the thing being loaded (`객체를 불러오는 중…`, `에이전트를 불러오는 중…`),
 *     while the bare form — which is what all ten of these keys are — is
 *     `… 로딩 중…` (`그리드 로딩 중…`, `차트 로딩 중…`, `양식 로딩 중…`).
 *   - **ar** → `جارٍ التحميل…` (was 8, plus `جاري التحميل…` ×2). See the separate
 *     note below: this one is a different class of defect from the other two.
 *   - en, zh, ja, fr, es, pt, ru were already unanimous and did not move.
 *
 * ## The `ar` pair is an ORTHOGRAPHY split, not a wording split
 *
 * `جارٍ` and `جاري` are not two translations; they are two spellings of one word.
 * `جارٍ` (jārin) is the indefinite form of a منقوص participle — the final yāʾ
 * drops and the rāʾ carries tanwīn (U+064D), which is the prescriptive MSA
 * spelling here. `جاري` (U+064A, the yāʾ retained) is the definite/annexed form,
 * widely used informally. So the two differ by one code point at the end of the
 * first word, and the fix is a normalization rather than a choice of words.
 *
 * That matters because the split does NOT respect this group's boundary: pack
 * wide, the standalone participle is `جارٍ` ×90 against `جاري` ×10, and only 2 of
 * those 10 are in this group. Converging the 2 is what the ruling asks for and
 * is what this pin can hold; the other 8 (`grid.loading`, `grid.refreshing`,
 * `chart.loading`, `console.initializing`, `console.loadingSteps.*` ×3,
 * `console.actions.retrying`) are a wider normalization filed separately rather
 * than smuggled in here, the same way #3878 fenced off the per-package fallback
 * tables. Read this block's green as a statement about this group only.
 *
 * ## The `de` fork, and why it is exempted BY NAME
 *
 * `auth.device.loading` is `Lade…` and stays `Lade…`. It is not an oversight and
 * it is not this pass's to settle: it is the one member of the group whose
 * outlier spelling is coherent with its own screen. `apps/console`'s
 * `DeviceAuthPage.tsx` renders all three of that namespace's in-flight states,
 * and de writes all three in the same first-person voice — `Genehmige…`,
 * `Ablehne…`, `Lade…` — while `approving`/`denying` are OUTSIDE this group (their
 * `en` is `Approving…`/`Denying…`). Converging `loading` alone would leave that
 * one screen reading `Genehmige… / Ablehne… / Wird geladen…`: a new same-screen
 * inconsistency manufactured by the very pass meant to remove one. Resolving it
 * the other way — moving the whole namespace to the passive — is a copy-voice
 * decision over keys this card does not fence in.
 *
 * So it is reported as a fork and pinned as an exemption. The pin asserts both
 * halves: the value, and that it still DIFFERS from the converged rendering. If
 * someone later converges it, this block goes red and the exemption row has to
 * be deleted — a deliberate act, which is the point.
 *
 * Contrast `approvalsInbox.loadingMore`, which the card floated as a possible
 * second fork (de `Lädt…`, ko `불러오는 중…`, on the theory that a *continuation*
 * load may want its own wording). Measurement says no, in both packs: de writes
 * all four of that namespace's other in-flight states passively
 * (`Wird genehmigt…`, `Wird abgelehnt…`, `Wird zurückgezogen…`,
 * `Wird erneut eingereicht…`), so `Lädt…` broke with its own neighbours rather
 * than marking anything; and ko used the same `불러오는 중…` on three plainly
 * INITIAL loads (`fields.recipient.loading`, `grid.bulk.loading`,
 * `grid.import.historyLoading`), so it cannot have been marking continuation
 * either. Both converge, and converging de there also restores the namespace.
