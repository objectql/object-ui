/**
 * `ObjectKanban`'s record-detail drawer heading still resolves to ENGLISH, and
 * to the SAME BYTES as before, when no `I18nProvider` is mounted —
 * objectui#3459.
 *
 * This is not a nice-to-have. Routing a literal through `t()` without a working
 * default is exactly how a provider-less consumer breaks, and it breaks in a
 * suite that is not this one: `object-kanban` is a public page block, so any
 * host that renders schema without mounting a provider (this package's own
 * tests, the preview gallery, an embedding app) reads whatever the defaults map
 * says. The English defaults live in `KANBAN_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`
 * (`ObjectKanban.tsx`) — that map is what `createSafeTranslation` falls back to
 * when its `detail.recordDetail` probe comes back unresolved.
 *
 * Direction: this file was GREEN before the change and is GREEN after. It pins
 * the FALLBACK, not the fix — the fix is asserted in
 * `ObjectKanban.overlayTitleI18n.test.tsx`. A missing map entry would have
 * turned it red by rendering the raw key `detail.recordDetailWithLabel`, which
 * is precisely the regression it exists to catch.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own FILE, not a describe block ────────────────────────
 * `createI18n` calls `instance.use(initReactI18next)`, and `initReactI18next`
 * registers that instance as **react-i18next's module-global default**. The
 * registration survives unmount and `cleanup()`. So the moment any test in a
 * file mounts `<I18nProvider config={{ defaultLanguage: 'zh' }}>`, every later
 * "no provider" render in that same file silently resolves against the Chinese
 * instance — a green-looking file that asserts nothing about the fallback.
 *
 * Vitest's `dom` project runs with `isolate: true`, so a file that never mounts
 * a provider gets a genuinely clean global. Keep it that way: **do not import
 * or mount `I18nProvider` here.**

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * objectui#7307 — this file's `/api/v1/security/explain` escape, served here.
 *
 * Nothing below asks for a security verdict, yet every run opened a REAL TCP
 * connection to `http://localhost:3000`. Traced with a stack probe on the
 * network-escape guard's attribution point (measured, not inferred):
 *
 *   RecordDetailDrawer (the drawer this file opens)
 *     -> DetailView            packages/plugin-detail/src/DetailView.tsx:290,296
 *       -> useRecordEditable   packages/plugin-detail/src/useRecordEditable.ts:76
 *         -> `const doFetch = apiFetch ?? fetch`      <- the escape
 *           POST /api/v1/security/explain  (twice per open: edit, then delete)
 *
 * The hook reads the host's AUTHENTICATED `apiFetch` off
 * `SchemaRendererContext` and, with no host supplying one, degrades to the
 * GLOBAL `fetch` by design — a standalone embed must keep rendering rather than
 * crash. Under happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL
 * defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live
 * request. The read is best-effort (a network or parse failure leaves the
 * record editable — fail open), which is why the cases below stayed green while
 * the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and
 * by this batch's sibling
 * `packages/plugin-calendar/src/ObjectCalendar.navWidthDefault.test.tsx`.
 * Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it records every URL it is handed
 * and `afterEach` fails on any URL that is not the explain route, so an escape
 * to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: the permissive
 * verdict, in the two response shapes the two explain hooks read —
 * `{ record: { visible } }` for a single `recordId`, and
 * `{ records: [{ recordId, visible }] }` for a batched `recordIds`. Only the
 * FIRST is reached from this file (every call measured above comes from
 * `useRecordEditable`); the batched branch is kept so this router stays
 * byte-identical to its siblings rather than forking per file.
 * `useRecordEditable` initialises `allowed` to `true` and its failure path
 * leaves it there, so `true` and the absent verdict the failing request
 * produced are the same value at every read site. The drawer's accessible
 * name — everything this file asserts — is not derived from the verdict at all.
