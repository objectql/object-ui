/**
 * objectui#5874 — this package's private copy of the reference-bearing field
 * family converges onto `@object-ui/core`'s `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES`.
 *
 * The copy was the inline disjunction `isLookup` inside `resolveDisplay`, the
 * card-description helper in `ObjectKanban.tsx`. It neither derived from nor
 * pinned against the shared set, and it diverged from it in BOTH directions:
 * it lacked `user` and `tree`, and carried a fifth spelling `reference` that no
 * producer can emit.
 *
 * ## Why the load-bearing pin is IDENTITY, not membership
 *
 * Every membership assertion below is satisfied by a private
 * `new Set(['lookup', 'master_detail', 'tree', 'user'])` holding the same
 * strings — i.e. by a re-fork of exactly the kind this change removed. So the
 * pin that decides the convergence spies on the `has` of the object core
 * exports: a call is recorded only if the face under test consulted THAT
 * object, so a member-identical private copy leaves the spy empty and fails
 * here, where a value check would pass ON the defect. Same shape as
 * objectui#4770 / #4790 / #4815 / #5312 / #5692.
 *
 * ## Where the pin sits now — objectui#6063 moved it to the LIVE read
 *
 * As written for #5874 this pin was attributed to `resolveDisplay`, and its
 * docblock recorded a finding: that read could not be paired with a
 * behavioural counter-probe, because the guard holding it was unreachable —
 *
 *     if (isLookup && isOpaqueId(raw)) return undefined;
 *     if (isOpaqueId(raw)) return undefined;
 *
 * — the second line subsuming the first for every input, so `isLookup` could
 * not change any outcome, in EITHER direction, that `ObjectKanban`'s rendered
 * output could show. objectui#6063 settled that fork in favour of the
 * unconditional line (the suppression is a rule about the VALUE, not about the
 * declared type) and deleted the dead branch — which deleted `resolveDisplay`'s
 * read of the shared family along with it. The behaviour that survives there is
 * pinned in `resolveDisplay.opaqueId-6063.test.tsx`.
 *
 * So the convergence claim for this face is re-anchored onto the read that is
 * actually live: `buildExpandFields`, called from the same module on every
 * fetch. That read is the better subject in both halves — a re-fork leaves the
 * spy empty exactly as before, AND its membership delta is observable, so the
 * counter-probe the #5874 docblock had to record as ABSENT now exists (last
 * describe block: a `user`-typed field reaches the wire in `$expand`, a
 * `text`-typed one does not).
 *
 * Ablation direction, predicted before running: replace `buildExpandFields`'
 * consultation with a member-identical private table and every identity pin
 * below goes RED (the spy records no call) while the member-set assertion stays
 * GREEN — that contrast is the whole reason the pin is on identity rather than
 * on members.

 *
 * ⚠️ The attribution is load-bearing, not decoration. `ObjectKanban.tsx` also
 * imported `buildExpandFields`, which consults the SAME shared object once per
 * schema field on every render. While `resolveDisplay` still held a read of its
 * own, a bare `vi.spyOn(...).mock.calls` pin therefore stayed GREEN with that
 * site re-forked — measured, not feared: the first draft of this file did
 * exactly that and survived its own ablation, so the pin was reporting on
 * `buildExpandFields`' calls and pinning nothing.
 *
 * objectui#6063 deleted that second site, so `buildExpandFields` is now the
 * only reader in this render (pinned executably below) and the filter is
 * currently equivalent to no filter. It is kept so that the day a second reader
 * appears it cannot silently satisfy this pin — the failure this file has
 * already been bitten by once.
