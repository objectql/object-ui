/**
 * objectui#7126, end to end: a required **text** field in the required-fields
 * dialog reports `aria-invalid` once its validation fails — and so do the other
 * four types whose widgets did not read the delivered key.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists next to the #7008 one
 *
 * `RequiredFieldsDialog.ariaInvalid-7008.test.tsx` pinned the same claim for
 * `select` and `textarea`, and its own header recorded WHY it could not use
 * `text`: `TextField`, `BooleanField`, `DateField`, `DateTimeField` and
 * `TimeField` did not read `error`, so for their types the dialog's delivery
 * was inert. That was the gap objectui#7126 closed, and this is the same
 * measurement taken again at the same seam now that the widgets read it.
 *
 * ⭐ `text` is why the gap was p2 rather than tidiness. It is the most common
 * field type in any object, so it is the likeliest thing a column makes
 * required — the live case in which a sighted user saw the red "Required" and a
 * screen-reader user was told nothing.
 *
 * ## What is NOT claimed
 *
 * Only the MARKING. The objectui#3222 slot drives `aria-invalid` and renders no
 * text; the visible hint is still the dialog's own red span, exactly as before.
 * Nothing became visible here that was not visible before.
