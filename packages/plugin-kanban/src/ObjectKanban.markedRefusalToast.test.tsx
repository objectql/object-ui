/**
 * A rejected card move must render the refusal text the PRODUCER marked as
 * user-facing, instead of substituting a generic string for it. objectui#5902,
 * inheriting the objectui#5210 ruling (already implemented for the console
 * form) onto this drag-write surface.
 *
 * ── Why this needs a surface pin and not a reader unit test ────────────────
 * `declaredUserMessage` already has unit tests, and
 * `error-message.normalisation-boundary.test.ts` already pins that the marking
 * survives the adapter's re-wraps. Neither of them can see this defect: the
 * marking arrived at this file intact and the toast dropped it on the floor.
 * The only thing that fails when a surface stops reading the marking is a pin
 * ON that surface, driven end to end.
 *
 * ── Fixtures come through the real boundary ───────────────────────────────
 * Every error below is built as a wire-shaped rejection and pushed through
 * `normaliseClientError`, the same adapter boundary a real `dataSource.update`
 * failure crosses. Hand-rolling the post-boundary shape here would pin this
 * surface against THIS file's idea of where the marking lives — which is the
 * asymmetry that makes it worth pinning at all: `ConcurrentUpdateError` parks
 * it on a typed top-level member, `DataApiValidationError` parks it in the
 * details bag, and a 403 is passed through untouched. All three must reach the
 * user identically, because the contract is status-agnostic.
 *
 * ── Direction of these pins ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - the three MARKED arms   → RED before the fix (they read the generic
 *                              substitution), GREEN after. These are the issue.
 *  - the three UNMARKED arms → GREEN before and after. Without them a fix that
 *                              simply printed `String(error)` would pass, and
 *                              that is the objectstack#3821 defect this
 *                              surface's substitution exists to prevent.
 *
 * The board is driven through `DndContext`'s real `onDragEnd`, captured by the
 * module mock below — the same harness `ObjectKanban.rejectedMoveRollback.test.tsx`
 * uses, and for the same reason: dnd-kit's pointer sensors need layout and
 * pointer-capture that jsdom does not provide.
