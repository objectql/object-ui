/**
 * useCapabilityGate — the UI half of ADR-0066 D4's `requiredPermissions`
 * contract, for surfaces that filter actions THEMSELVES.
 *
 * `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` applies this gate for everything routed
 * through the engine. But several renderers filter their own action lists —
 * `page:header` (record_header / record_more) and the grid's row-action menu
 * (list_item) — and each of those bypassed the engine entirely, so a button
 * declaring a capability nobody holds still rendered (framework#3923). One hook
 * so all three surfaces gate identically and can't drift apart.
 *
 * Source of truth for what the caller holds: the ActionProvider's runner
 * context (`user.systemPermissions`) — the same object the engine reads — with
 * the ambient predicate scope as fallback for hosts that mount an
 * ExpressionProvider but no action runtime.
 *
 * **Fail-OPEN when unknown.** No runner, no user, no `systemPermissions` array:
 * the action shows. Unknown is not denied, the server is the authority
 * (the framework's ADR-0057 D10 — framework numbering; this repo's own
 * ADR-0057 is an unrelated document), and hiding a permitted user's button on
 * missing client data is the worse failure. An EMPTY array is not unknown —
 * it means "holds
 * nothing" and gates normally.
