 *
 * The analytics label net's REACT half (objectui#4389) — the fetch-and-memo
 * glue that carries a dataset query's dimension metadata to the pure
 * `@object-ui/core` helpers that decide what a label IS.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it is not
 *
 * Nothing here decides a label. The resolution rules are all core's, and were
 * never duplicated: `loadDimensionFieldMeta` → `resolveDimensionFieldMeta`, and
 * `deriveDimensionLabelMaps` → `buildDimensionLabelMap`, with the translator
 * bound by `dimensionOptionTranslator` to `{ns}.fieldOptions.<object>.<field>.<value>`
 * — the one convention list and form surfaces already translate select options
 * through. What this hook owns is only the three things core structurally
 * cannot: the host context read, the state, and the memo boundary between them.
 *
 * ## Why it lives HERE
 *
 * objectui#4389 filed the glue as duplicated between `plugin-dashboard`'s
 * `DatasetWidget` and `plugin-report`'s `useDatasetDimensionLabels` (both
 * created by PR #4388), and named `@object-ui/core` as its home. That home was
 * retired by measurement, and the card's PM RULING #2 records the correction:
 * `SchemaRendererContext` is defined in THIS package, which depends on
 * `@object-ui/core`, so core importing it back is a cycle; core is also
 * React-free by declaration, by content, and by AGENTS.md §3. This package is
 * the one place that is downstream of core (the helpers are reachable),
 * downstream of `@object-ui/i18n` (`useSafeFieldLabel` is reachable), the owner
 * of `SchemaRendererContext` (`apiFetch` is a local read), and upstream of both
 * consuming plugins. It already hosts this exact fetch-and-memo-off-`apiFetch`
 * shape three times over — `useViewData`, `useElementDataSource`, `useDiscovery`.
 *
 * ## The two properties this hook exists to state ONCE
 *
 * Both are bug fixes that were previously written out on each surface, which is
 * the drift objectui#4389 was filed to close:
 *
 * 1. **The read rides the host's AUTHENTICATED `apiFetch` (objectui#4121)**, so
 *    `apiFetch` is IN the effect's deps. A bearer-token session carries its
 *    credential in the `Authorization` header, not a cookie, so
 *    `credentials: 'include'` alone left this read unauthenticated in a hosted
 *    console — and because the net is best-effort, the symptom was not an error
 *    but option colours and dimension labels silently never applying. The
 *    context is consulted DIRECTLY rather than through a `useSchemaContext()`
 *    that throws, so a surface rendered outside a host keeps degrading to the
 *    global `fetch` instead of crashing the render.
 * 2. **The fetched metadata stays LOCALE-FREE in state (objectui#4030 /
 *    PR #4324)**, so the locale is NOT in the effect's deps. The bundle is
 *    applied one memo down, in {@link useDatasetDimensionLabels}, which is what
 *    makes a language switch re-label in place instead of re-issuing the
 *    metadata read.
 *
 * Both are pinned in `useDatasetDimensionLabels.test.tsx`, which asserts them
 * at this seam — the level the per-plugin pins cannot state, since neither
 * plugin can observe that the OTHER one inherits the same wiring.
