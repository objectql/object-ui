/**
 * The dashboard heading resolves an INLINE locale map label (objectui#4580).
 *
 * `BaseSchema.label` accepts `string | I18nLabel` since #4580's revised Q1
 * ruling. `DashboardGridLayout` renders `schema.label` into an `<h2 >` text
 * node, which is the fourth and last site the widening's compiler inventory
 * named repo-wide (the other three are `@object-ui/components` renderers,
 * pinned in that package's `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx`).
 *
 * ## Red-first — measured BEFORE the fix, verbatim
 *
 * Rendering with `label: { en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }` against the
 * unfixed source THREW:
 *
 * ```
 * Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {en, zh-CN}).
 * If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why `pickLocalized`, not the spec's `resolveI18nLabel`
 *
 * This component ALREADY resolves the sibling slot — `widget.title`, the same
 * inline-map vocabulary — with `pickLocalized(widget.title, language)` against
 * `useObjectTranslation().language`. Adding the spec resolver plus
 * `useDisplayLocale()` here would put two resolvers AND two locale channels in
 * one component for one vocabulary, and those channels genuinely disagree:
 * `useDisplayLocale()` prefers the tenant's regional default over the active UI
 * language, so a heading and the widget titles beneath it could resolve to
 * different languages in the same render.
 *
 * That is not a tolerant fallback standing in for the real resolver:
 * `pickLocalized` is objectui's limb-for-limb twin of `resolveI18nLabel`
 * (objectstack#6765 aligned them deliberately), and the ONLY difference is how
 * each spells a miss — `''` here for a text node, `undefined` there for a
 * producer's `?? name` chain — pinned in
 * `plugin-list/src/__tests__/i18nLabel-resolver-parity.test.ts`.
