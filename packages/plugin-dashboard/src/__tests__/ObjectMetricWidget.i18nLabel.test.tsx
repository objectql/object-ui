/**
 * objectui#5264 — `ObjectMetricWidgetProps` was the last interface in
 * any package's shipped `src` still declaring the `{ key, defaultValue }`
 * key-reference label form that objectstack#5055 RETIRED at rc.6. The sibling
 * `MetricWidgetProps` was migrated for exactly this reason in objectui#4358;
 * this one was missed in that pass.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS NOT MERELY INERT. `ObjectMetricWidget` forwards `label` /
 * `description` / `trend` straight to `MetricWidget`, which resolves them with
 * `pickLocalized`. The retired object hits no locale limb, so resolution falls
 * through to the last resort — "first string property in insertion order" — and
 * the natural `{ key, defaultValue }` spelling therefore paints the raw dotted
 * translation key onto the KPI card. Write the same two properties the other
 * way round and the English falls out instead. That PROPERTY-ORDER DEPENDENCE
 * is why the defect never read as systematic, and it is covered here in both
 * orders.
 *
 * DIRECTIONS, written before the reverse verification was run:
 *
 *  - **(a) inline-map `label` / `description` / `trend.label` on the CARD →
 *    GREEN on both sides.** These three were already forwarded to
 *    `pickLocalized` by `MetricWidget`, so the migration does not move them.
 *    They are the non-vacuity floor: they prove the harness renders what it
 *    claims to, so a red elsewhere is a real red.
 *  - **(b) inline-map `title` in the DRILL-DOWN DRAWER → RED before.** The
 *    drawer's `drawerTitle` read `title?.defaultValue` directly. An inline
 *    per-locale map has no such limb, so an authored drill title resolved to
 *    `''` and the drawer fell back to the literal word "Details" — a plausible
 *    heading that silently discards what the author wrote.
 *  - **(c) inline-map `label` as the drawer's fallback title → RED before**,
 *    same limb, same substitution.
 *  - **(d) card/drawer COHERENCE under the retired form, key-first → RED
 *    before.** This is the order-dependence made executable without
 *    fossilizing any resolved text. Before the change the two surfaces used
 *    DIFFERENT resolvers — the card `pickLocalized` (order-dependent), the
 *    drawer `.defaultValue` (order-independent) — so one KPI tile painted the
 *    raw dotted key while the drawer it opened painted the English. They now
 *    share one resolver and cannot disagree.
 *  - **(e) card/drawer coherence under the retired form, defaultValue-first →
 *    GREEN on both sides.** The other half of the order pair, and the reason
 *    (d) is a genuine finding rather than a blanket failure: before the change
 *    exactly ONE of the two orders diverged.
 *  - **(f) the accept set — the inline map → RED before, at COMPILE time.**
 *    This one was predicted the other way round and the prediction was wrong;
 *    the measurement is recorded here because it changes what this migration
 *    is. `I18nLabel`'s object half is `InlineLocaleMap`, and that erases to
 *    `Record<string, string>` in the emitted `.d.ts` — the BCP-47 key regex is
 *    a Zod RUNTIME refinement and does not survive into the type. So:
 *
 *      old `string | { key?: string; defaultValue?: string }`
 *        accepts `{ key, defaultValue }` (both orders)
 *        REJECTS `{ en, 'zh-CN' }` with TS2353 — excess property `en`
 *      new `string | I18nLabel`
 *        accepts `{ en, 'zh-CN' }`
 *        still accepts `{ key, defaultValue }` — every string key fits a
 *        `Record<string, string>` index signature
 *
 *    So this migration ADDS the only vocabulary the spec admits (a TS consumer
 *    writing the correct form previously got a compile error) and REMOVES
 *    nothing. It is a widening at the type level, not the narrowing it reads
 *    like. The retired form is refused where refusal is actually expressible —
 *    `I18nLabelSchema` at authoring time, pinned below in both orders.
 *
 *    That is also why there is no `@ts-expect-error` tombstone here: one was
 *    written first and `tsc` reported both directives UNUSED. Per objectui#4032's
 *    fixture-triage discipline the same trap applies to a tombstone as to a
 *    fixture — an assertion that passes for the wrong reason is worse than none.
