 * objectui#4426 — the RUNTIME half of the KPI cards' DOM pass-through contract.
 *
 * Both components end their prop list with a `...domProps` spread onto the
 * Shadcn `Card`, and objectui#4357 (PR #4428) kept that spread deliberately: it
 * is their only accessibility pass-through. But neither props interface extended
 * `React.HTMLAttributes`, so what the runtime accepted the TYPE refused:
 *
 * ```
 * probe.tsx(11,5): error TS2322: Type '{ label: string; value: number; id: string;
 *   role: string; "aria-label": string; … }' is not assignable to type
 *   'IntrinsicAttributes & MetricWidgetProps & SchemaHostProps'.
 *     Property 'id' does not exist on type '…'.
 * ```
 *
 * A JS consumer, and every SDUI author going through `SchemaRenderer` (untyped
 * at that boundary), got the pass-through; a TypeScript consumer importing the
 * component directly needed a cast.
 *
 * ## What is asserted WHERE, and why the split is not arbitrary
 *
 * The defect was type-only — `id` / `role` / `aria-label` reached the card the
 * whole time — so the fix's own direction cannot be observed by anything vitest
 * runs. The compile-time assertions therefore live in `../domPassthroughPins.ts`,
 * a SOURCE module the package's `tsc --noEmit` actually compiles. They are not
 * here, and deliberately so: this package's tests are compiled by nothing
 * (`tsconfig.json` excludes `**\/*.test.tsx`, the package is the sole remaining
 * `TEST_DEBT` entry in `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs`, and vitest erases
 * types), which is objectui#3181 — assertions in an uncompiled test file read as
 * coverage and are decoration. A `@ts-expect-error` written here would be
 * especially dishonest: nothing would ever check that the error it expects still
 * happens.
 *
 * What IS real here, and only here: that those attributes actually land on the
 * element, and that `title` does NOT. Case (c) is the one that would catch the
 * tempting bad fix for the `title` collision — declaring the inherited DOM
 * `title` instead of omitting it would type-check, read as a supported tooltip,
 * and silently do nothing (objectui#3290 / objectui#3222's first-class failure).
 *
 * DIRECTIONS, written before the run: all three cases are GREEN on both sides of
 * #4426 at RUNTIME — the spread already forwarded these attributes, and this
 * change adds no runtime behaviour at all. They are a regression floor for the
 * spread `MetricWidget.domProps.test.tsx` case (e) protects from the other side,
 * not evidence of the type fix. The type fix's before/after direction is the
 * pins file, and is recorded in the PR.
