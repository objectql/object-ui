/**
 * `@object-ui/plugin-calendar` ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision tripwire
 * (objectui#4650). Sibling of `spec-symbol-4650.test.ts` in plugin-grid,
 * plugin-form and plugin-kanban — one card, four packages, one verdict.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec/ui` owns `ObjectCalendarProps` from 17.0.0: it is the
 * AUTHORED props document of the `object-calendar` element (`z.input<typeof
 * ObjectCalendarPropsSchema>`), a serialisable authoring surface. This package's
 * same-named interface was the RENDERER's props — a live `dataSource`, records
 * pre-fetched by a parent, eight host callbacks — so the two are different
 * things under one word, and the local one was renamed to
 * `ObjectCalendarComponentProps` rather than derived. Same verdict and same
 * suffix as `PageHeaderProps` -> `PageHeaderComponentProps` (app-shell) and the
 * `Record*ComponentProps` family in `@object-ui/types`.
 *
 * This package had TWO of the card's six collisions, not one: the interface, and
 * the barrel's `export type { ObjectCalendarProps };` — a re-export with no
 * `from` clause, which `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` judges as its
 * own declaration (the barrel skip it applies to `export … from './x'` cannot
 * apply when there is no module specifier to recognise). The barrel now spells
 * the alias with its `from` clause, so the name is judged once, at the
 * declaration.
 *
 * See the plugin-grid sibling for why these are compile-time pins rather than a
 * runtime name probe, and why the "the spec still owns the old name" half of the
 * ratchet is not asserted before the pin reaches GA.
 *
 * Compiled by this package's `tsconfig.test.json` (objectui#3181) — without
 * that, every `Assert<…>` below is erased before vitest runs and proves nothing.
