/**
 * `@object-ui/plugin-calendar` <-> `@object-ui/types` `CalendarEvent`
 * name-collision tripwire (objectui#5044). Sibling of
 * `spec-symbol-4650.test.ts` next door — same package, same verdict shape, a
 * different owner of the contested name.
 *
 * ## What collided
 *
 * Two structurally incompatible PUBLIC exports were both called
 * `CalendarEvent`:
 *
 *   - `@object-ui/types` — the AUTHORING event: `id: string`, `start` / `end`
 *     accepting ISO strings with `end` REQUIRED, plus a `description`. It is
 *     the declared payload of the host-only `onEventClick` callback.
 *   - `@object-ui/plugin-calendar` — the `CalendarView` component's RUNTIME
 *     event: `id: string | number`, `start: Date`, `end?: Date`, no
 *     `description`.
 *
 * Neither is assignable to the other (`id` and `start` each conflict), and IDE
 * auto-import chooses between two identical names by alphabetical order or
 * most-recent use. The wrong choice did not surface as "you imported from the
 * wrong package": it surfaced as a remote `TS2322: Type 'string' is not
 * assignable to type 'Date'` several lines away. That is measured, not
 * predicted — `packages/plugin-calendar/README.md`'s own example stayed
 * uncompilable straight through objectui#5010's import-path fix, because
 * neither name was fabricated and neither path was wrong.
 *
 * ## The ruling this pins (2026-08-19 maintainer ruling on objectui#5044)
 *
 * Option A, following the objectui#4650 precedent: the AUTHORING type keeps the
 * canonical name `CalendarEvent` (it is the spec-side contract name), the
 * RUNTIME type is renamed to `CalendarViewEvent`, and a `@deprecated`
 * `CalendarEvent` alias stays behind on the plugin barrel so existing importers
 * keep compiling. Option B (stop exporting the runtime type) was rejected as
 * breaking with unmeasurable external cost; option C (a docs note) was rejected
 * as leaving the trap armed.
 *
 * So the assertions below are about the PUBLISHED NAME SET and the shapes those
 * names denote. Behaviour does not change in this card and nothing here claims
 * it did — a test that renders a calendar cannot see any of this.
 *
 * ## Legs that do NOT discriminate, and are therefore not written
 *
 *   - Rendering a `CalendarView` with events: green before and after the
 *     rename, under either name. It measures the component, not the name set.
 *   - `typeof CalendarEvent` at runtime: both are TYPES, erased before vitest
 *     ever loads this file. There is no runtime value to probe, which is
 *     exactly why the pins below are compile-time.
 *
 * Compiled by this package's `tsconfig.test.json` (objectui#3181) — without
 * that, every `Assert<...>` below is erased before vitest runs and proves
 * nothing. That config also drops the root `paths`, so `@object-ui/types`
 * resolves through the workspace dependency's BUILT `.d.ts` — the surface a
 * consumer actually imports, not a sibling source tree.
