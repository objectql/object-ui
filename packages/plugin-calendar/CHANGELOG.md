### Minor Changes

- 515328f: `calendar-view` has no declared-but-inert inputs left: `allowCreate` works, `colorMapping` is retired (objectui#4454, objectui#4493)

  Two of this widget's registry inputs were declared and read by nobody — the one
  state ADR-0049's enforce-or-remove framing says must not persist. Measurement
  answered them in opposite directions.

  **`allowCreate` is enforced.** The handler it would gate was already built in the
  renderer — `handleAddClick`, dispatching `{ type: 'create', payload: {} }` on the
  widget's own `onAction` channel — and simply never passed. `CalendarView` renders
  its **New event** button behind `onAddClick`, so on the SDUI path that button
  never existed and the handler was unreachable: both halves of one feature were
  present and had never been introduced to each other. An authored
  `allowCreate: true` now supplies the handler to `onAddClick`, and clicking the
  button dispatches the create action.

  The wiring goes through the declared `onAddClick` hatch rather than around it via
  a second prop. That key is already one of the renderer's function-typed host
  hatches (objectui#4453), so a React host could switch the affordance on today and
  that path is untouched — a host handler still replaces the action dispatch rather
  than running alongside it, the same precedence `onEventClick` keeps. An authored
  `onAddClick` string is still dropped, so turning the affordance on cannot
  reintroduce that card's uncaught handler crash.

  Only the boolean `true` turns it on. Absent, `false`, and the off-type spellings
  JSON invites (`'true'`, `1`, an object) all resolve to the absent-key answer, which
  on this prop is literally what makes the button not render. Every node that never
  authored the key renders exactly as before.

  **`colorMapping` is removed.** It had no read site anywhere: the renderer's event
  mapping takes the colour straight off the record (`color: record[colorField]`),
  and `CalendarView` resolves a colour from `event.color`. An author who wrote the
  documented `colorMapping: { meeting: 'blue' }` got no mapping, no warning and no
  error — the raw field value was used as the colour, which for a picklist value
  like `meeting` is not a colour at all. It is retired rather than implemented
  because no measured app authors it, and a capability with no pull behind it is not
  worth building. The `content/docs/plugins/plugin-calendar.mdx` schema-API line
  documenting it is removed in the same change.

  Retiring it is not a behaviour change — the key never had a read site to lose. It
  becomes an ordinary unknown authored key, dropped at the renderer boundary like
  any other.

  **Grade.** Minor, not patch: measured both ways against the emitted bundle, the
  published registry surface moves — `calendar-view`'s `inputs` array loses a member
  (`colorMapping`: 1 emitted declaration before, 0 after), so the authorable
  vocabulary this widget publishes narrows by one key, and a second declared input
  starts producing a user-visible affordance. The emitted `.d.ts` is byte-identical
  either way; the vocabulary lives in the runtime registry metadata, not in the type
  surface.

### Patch Changes

- 395e154: authored ISO `currentDate` reaches the calendar as a `Date`; unparseable input falls back to the default instead of crashing

  `plugin-calendar:calendar-view` declares the input `{ name: 'currentDate', type: 'string', description: 'ISO date string for initial calendar date' }`, while `CalendarViewProps.currentDate` is a `Date`. Nothing converted between the two: the authored string rode the renderer's trailing `{...props}` spread into `useState`'s initial `selectedDate`, and the header's `selectedDate.toLocaleDateString(…)` threw `selectedDate.toLocaleDateString is not a function` — the error boundary instead of the calendar. Writing the one spelling the input documents was the one spelling that could not work, and there was no correct authored value at all, since `type: 'string'` cannot express a `Date`.

  The renderer now owes the conversion, at its own boundary. `currentDate` is destructured out of the incoming props so the spread can no longer carry the raw value (the consumed-key pattern from the `events` collision fix), parsed once per authored value, and passed to `CalendarView` as the `Date` its prop type declares. Off-spec input — an unparseable string, or any non-string that is not already a `Date` — gets the same answer as an absent key: the component's own default date. An `Invalid Date` is never manufactured and handed on; it does not throw, it renders the literal text "Invalid Date" into the header and the date picker, which is a silent wrong answer where the default is a usable calendar.

  A `Date` instance passes through untouched, so a React host handing the widget its real declared prop type is unaffected.

- c5756ff: `calendar-view` consumes or declares every prop it forwards — an authored `onEventClick` can no longer crash a click

  `calendar-view`'s renderer ended in `<CalendarView … {...props} />`, where `props` was everything `SchemaRenderer` hands a registered widget: the node's authored keys, the contents of its `props` container, the injected runtime props, and a host's trailing props. That is an unbounded set spread onto a component whose props are a closed list, and the worst collision on it was `onEventClick`: an authored `onEventClick: 'NOT-A-FUNCTION'` rendered a perfectly normal calendar and then threw `onEventClick is not a function` on the first click. React does not route event-handler errors to `SchemaErrorBoundary`, so it surfaced as an uncaught window error — the calendar kept looking fine while its click handling was dead. Both authoring channels reached it, the node's own key and a `props: { onEventClick }` container.

  The forward set is now exactly `CalendarViewProps`, each key resolved to the type that prop declares; nothing else reaches the component. Declared registry inputs are consumed (`view` narrowed to its declared enum, `currentDate` parsed, `className` forwarded, the field-name inputs read off the schema); `CalendarView`'s callbacks are a declared, function-typed host escape hatch — a host-passed function is forwarded exactly as before, and a non-function value, which is all an SDUI author writing JSON can produce, is dropped, the same answer as an absent key; every other key is dropped.

  Fixed with it, from the same boundary: an authored `onAction` string killed the same click through the renderer's own action channel; an authored `onDateClick` / `onNavigate` / `onViewChange` / `onEventDrop` / `onTimeRangeSelect` / `onAddClick` string killed its own gesture the same way; an authored `locale` that `Intl` rejects (`en_US`, the underscore spelling) took the whole render down to the error boundary with `RangeError: Incorrect locale information provided`; and an off-enum `view` (`agenda`) rendered a header with no calendar under it at all, where it now falls back to the component's `month` default.

  No capability is removed and no authorable surface is added: every host path that worked keeps working, including the handler precedence the old spread produced (a host handler replaces the `onAction` dispatch rather than running alongside it). The package's emitted `.d.ts` is unchanged.

- 49b9de6: fix(plugin-calendar): authoring `events` on a `calendar-view` node no longer takes the calendar down

  `calendar-view`'s renderer computed a `CalendarEvent[]` from `schema.data`, passed it
  as `events={…}`, then spread the remaining props **after** it. `SchemaRenderer`
  forwards a node's `events` key as a plain prop, so a node authoring `events` — the
  ordinary SDUI action metadata, legal on any node — landed its `{ onClick: [...] }`
  object on the `events` array prop: `CalendarView` iterated it and threw
  `events is not iterable`, and a spec-legal node rendered an error card instead of its
  calendar.

  The authored key is now destructured out before the spread, so the computed array
  always wins. This also closes the quiet half of the same collision: an authored
  `events` **array** never threw — it silently replaced the calendar's contents with
  itself.

  No capability is removed. Nothing in the renderer layer consumes a node's `events`
  key (the action path is `properties.action` through `ActionRunner`), and the
  component's own `onAction` channel is unaffected.

- 3e579d6: `object-calendar` / `view:calendar`: the renderer now consumes or declares every prop it forwards, instead of spreading the authored node into `ObjectCalendar`

  One shared renderer serves both registrations, and it ended in a raw spread of everything `SchemaRenderer` hands a widget — the node's authored keys, its `props` container, the injected runtime props and a host's trailing props — onto a component whose props are a closed list. `ObjectCalendarProps` declares eight callbacks and a `locale`, so an authored value under any of those names landed on the declared prop, and an SDUI author writing JSON can never produce a function:

  - an authored `onDateClick` string threw `onDateClick is not a function` on an empty day-cell click, and an authored `onNavigate` string threw on **Next period** — both as _uncaught_ window errors, because React does not route event-handler errors to `SchemaErrorBoundary`, so the calendar kept looking fine while that gesture was dead;
  - an authored `locale: 'en_US'` (the underscore spelling a producer writes by accident) threw `RangeError: Incorrect locale information provided` out of render and took the whole calendar to the error boundary.

  The forward set is now exactly `ObjectCalendarProps`, each key resolved to the type that prop declares: the callback family is a declared, function-typed host escape hatch, `locale` is accepted only when `Intl.getCanonicalLocales` takes it, `data`/`loading` keep the parent pre-fetch path at their declared types, and everything else — including the open tail of authored keys — is dropped.

  Host-passed functions are unaffected: a React host's handlers, and `ListView`'s `onRowClick`, still reach the component exactly as before.

## 17.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 5bfaabd: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches every object-bound block, not just
  `list-view` — and `element:record_picker` stops discarding `view`
  (objectstack#6953).

  objectstack#5576 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to `list-view` and left
  the same declaration inert on every other page component. Two gaps remained, and
  both were silent:

  - **`element:record_picker` read four of the five keys and dropped `view`.** So
    `dataSource: { object: 'account', view: 'hot' }` — the spec's own example —
    built a picker over EVERY account instead of the rows the saved view selects.
    Nothing threw and nothing rendered an error; the option list was simply wider
    than what was authored, which also means a user could select a record the page
    said was out of scope.
  - **`object-grid` / `object-form` / `object-kanban` / `object-calendar` /
    `object-chart` / `object-metric` / `record:related_list` read none of it.**
    Each gates its fetch on its own `objectName`, and nothing mapped
    `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page written the way the spec documents
    rendered an empty grid / a field-less form / a board with no cards / an empty
    month / an empty chart / a static metric number — with no request and no
    diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
    objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged on every block:
  a named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error instead of
  degrading to the object's full scope.

  - `@object-ui/react` — new `useElementDataSourceSchema(schema, mapping, dataSource?)`
    and `ElementDataSourceGate` apply a resolved binding to the schema keys a given
    block reads, plus `ElementDataSourceErrorPanel` / `ElementDataSourceLoadingPanel`
    for the two non-final states. One precedence table for all blocks rather than
    one copy per block — that copy is how "additional filter criteria" would have
    become two dialects.
  - A mapping names **only** keys its block genuinely reads. A composed value
    written onto a key the block ignores would be accepted and dropped, which is
    the defect being removed, one layer deeper — so a kanban's swimlane `columns`
    never receive a view's field list, and a block with no row cap leaves `limit`
    unmapped. The per-block coverage table, including two residual gaps that are
    named rather than papered over, is in `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour changes for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

### Patch Changes

- 7d46648: fix(hooks): stop calling translation hooks inside try/catch (objectui#2879)

  Eleven call sites wrapped a React hook in `try`/`catch` to make it
  "provider-safe". `useObjectTranslation` and `useObjectLabel` already are — they
  read context optionally and fall back to react-i18next's global instance, and
  never throw. The `catch` bought nothing and cost correctness: a throw _after_
  the hook ran desyncs hook order on the next render, because React matches hooks
  positionally. objectui#2595/#2596 fixed exactly this in `@object-ui/i18n`'s
  `createSafeTranslation`; nine plugin-local re-implementations kept their own
  copy of the bug, and two more (`ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectView`) were found by the
  new lint rule below — `ObjectView` had even suppressed
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` inline to keep it.

  - Six exact re-implementations now delegate to `createSafeTranslation`:
    `plugin-detail`, `plugin-timeline`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-calendar`,
    `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid`, `plugin-designer`.
  - `components`' `data-table` also delegates; `createSafeTranslation` now
    returns `language` alongside `t` so consumers that localize dates don't need
    a second hook call. Purely additive.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-grid`'s `ImportWizard` keep their local hooks —
    they fall back _per key_, which a single-probe factory cannot express and
    which their comments justify (a host dictionary that covers common keys but
    lags on newer ones). Only the `try`/`catch` is removed.
  - `ObjectTimeline` and `ObjectView` call the hook directly and probe the
    returned value, mirroring `useSafeFieldLabel`.

  Adds `object-ui/no-try-catch-around-hook` (error) so a twelfth copy fails CI.
  It only matches `use*` names, accepts member calls solely on `React` (so
  `vi.useRealTimers()` is not a hook), and resets its try-depth inside nested
  functions (so `renderHook(() => useThing())` inside a `try` is fine) — both
  false positives were real code in this repo and are pinned in the rule's tests.

  `eslint-rules/**/*.test.js` matched no vitest project glob, so the local
  plugin's specs had never run in CI. They are now included; all three pass.

  `ObjectTimeline`'s test mock of `@object-ui/react` omitted `useObjectLabel` —
  the removed `try`/`catch` had been silently absorbing that gap. The mock is now
  complete.

### Patch Changes

- 549c67d: chore(lint): clear the mechanical baseline lint errors so these packages' lint gates protect them again

  Extends the fields/core cleanup from #2709 (objectui#2713). These eight package
  lints were red at baseline on `main`, so their per-package `lint` gate could not
  catch new violations of the same class. Cleared every **error** (no behavior
  change; warnings are out of scope):

  - **`no-useless-catch`** (`data-objectstack`) — unwrapped five try/catch blocks
    whose `catch` only re-threw; errors still propagate identically.
  - **`preserve-caught-error`** (`cli`, `data-objectstack`, `react`) — the caught
    error's message is inlined into the thrown `Error`; a scoped disable with a
    justifying comment carries each one, because these packages target ES2020
    whose lib types the 1-arg `Error` constructor only (so `{ cause }` won't
    compile) — same reasoning as the core case in #2709.
  - **`prefer-const`** (`plugin-calendar`, `plugin-map`) — `let`→`const` for
    never-reassigned bindings.
  - **`no-empty-object-type`** (`plugin-designer`) — empty extend-only interfaces
    → equivalent `type` aliases.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`react`) — dropped a dead initializer that both
    branches overwrite before it is read.
  - **`no-require-imports`** (`plugin-calendar`, `plugin-timeline` tests) —
    hoisted `vi.mock` factories now use an `async` factory with
    `await import('react')` instead of `require('react')`.
  - **stale `eslint-disable` directive** (`plugin-markdown`) — removed a
    `react/no-danger` disable whose plugin is not loaded in the flat config (an
    unknown-rule reference that ESLint v10 reports as an error); the rationale is
    kept as a plain comment.

## 4.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 7c9b85c: Fix compatibility with the framework's normalized Expression envelope format.

  `@objectstack/spec` now emits predicate (`visible` / `enabled`) and template
  (`titleFormat`) fields as `{ dialect, source }` envelopes instead of bare
  strings. The previous implementation assumed strings and crashed the record
  detail view (`TypeError: titleFormat.replace is not a function`) and printed
  `Failed to evaluate expression: ${[object Object]}` for every action visibility
  predicate.

  - `@object-ui/core`: `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate` / `evaluateCondition` now
    unwrap Expression envelopes transparently.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `toPredicateInput()` helper to safely normalize
    `boolean | string | Expression` predicate inputs into the `${expr}` form
    expected by `useCondition`.
  - `@object-ui/components`: `action-bar`, `action-button`, `action-group`,
    `action-icon`, `action-menu` renderers use `toPredicateInput()` instead of
    template-literal interpolation that produced `${[object Object]}`.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`, `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`,
    `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/app-shell`,
    `@object-ui/console`: title-format helpers accept both legacy strings and
    the new `{ source }` envelope.

  All changes are backward-compatible — legacy bare strings continue to work.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

### Patch Changes

- b2be122: fix(mobile): round 2 — kanban readability, calendar default view, timeline dot clipping

  **Kanban**

  - Remove `font-mono` from card titles, descriptions, column headers, and empty-state labels — CRM cards no longer render in a monospace font.
  - Constrain column body height (`max-h-full min-h-0` + `h-full` on the layout root) so `ScrollArea` activates and cards don't bleed past the viewport bottom.
  - Opportunistically derive `description` (e.g. `$60K · Acme Corp · @owner`) and up to two `badges` (priority/severity/industry/rating) in `ObjectKanban` when the schema/source omits them, giving mobile cards more context at a glance.

  **Calendar**

  - `ObjectCalendar` previously hardcoded `view={schema.defaultView ?? 'month'}`, making the view-selector dropdown a no-op. Wire the `view` state through to the `<Calendar>` prop so user selection is respected.
  - On mobile (viewport < 768 px) coerce `day` defaults to `month` via a synchronous lazy initialiser and a resize/orientation effect — avoids the useless 24-hour empty-hour grid for date-only events.

  **Timeline**

  - Add `ml-3` to the `<Timeline>` `<ol>` so the `absolute -left-3` marker dots are no longer clipped at the scroll-container edge.
