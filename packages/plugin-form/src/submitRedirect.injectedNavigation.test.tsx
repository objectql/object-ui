 *
 * objectui#4989 **defect 4 — mount-blindness — is fixed here**, by the
 * mechanism the maintainer ruled on 2026-08-17: an OPTIONAL INJECTED
 * navigation seam (`HostNavigationContext`, `@object-ui/react`).
 *
 * This file REPLACES `submitRedirect.mountBlind.test.tsx`, which pinned the
 * same defect from the other side while it was open. That file's own docblock
 * asked for exactly this: "when defect 4 is decided and implemented, this file
 * is expected to be REPLACED (not merely re-spelled) by one asserting the mount
 * is applied". Its measurement is not discarded — the origin-root resolution it
 * recorded is still the behaviour of a host that supplies no seam, and that is
 * pinned below as a supported state rather than a defect, because a host with
 * no router has no basename for a renderer to miss.
 *
 * ## What each half of the seam is worth asserting
 *
 * With a seam, the destination must reach the HOST — this package must stop
 * resolving it itself. What the host then does with the path is the host's
 * (React Router applies the basename; that leg is pinned for real, against a
 * real `<MemoryRouter basename>`, in
 * `packages/app-shell/src/console/HostNavigationBridge.test.tsx`). So the
 * assertions here are: which function receives the path, that it is the
 * RESOLVED path (interpolated + escaped, not the authored string), and that
 * every property the redirect already had — the contract verdict, the declared
 * delay, the unmount cancel — is unchanged by injecting one.
 *
 * The mount-application test below therefore uses a STUB host navigate that
 * joins a mount, and says so: it demonstrates the seam's consequence at this
 * layer (the renderer hands over a path a host can still place), not React
 * Router's behaviour, which is not this package's to prove.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — predicted first, then measured (counts are measured)
 *
 * 1. **Ablating the seam** — `useSubmitRedirectNavigation` ignores the injected
 *    navigate and always calls `window.location.assign` (i.e. the pre-ruling
 *    body): **8 of the 12 tests here go RED**, and the 4 absent-seam /
 *    refusal-with-seam tests stay green. That split is the point: the survivors
 *    are exactly the ones describing behaviour that was already correct, so the
 *    file cannot pass by describing the old world.
 * 2. **Removing the `HostNavigationBridge` from `ConsoleShell`** (the supply
 *    side): nothing here moves — 0 red — and the app-shell file goes red
 *    instead. Recorded because it is the honest statement of what a
 *    package-local test can and cannot see: a seam with no supplier is
 *    invisible from inside the package that reads it.
 * 3. **Dropping `encodeURIComponent` from `submitRedirect.ts`**: `hands over the
 *    RESOLVED path` goes red here, on top of the counts the two component files
 *    already record — the seam carries the resolved value, so the escape is
 *    observable through it.
