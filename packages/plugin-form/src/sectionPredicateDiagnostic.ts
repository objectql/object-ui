/**
 * The one layout arm that still DROPS an authored `FormSection.visibleWhen`
 * (objectui#6237).
 *
 * Of the six layout routes in `ObjectForm`, five honour the predicate:
 * `split` / `drawer` / `modal` rebuild each section key by key and copy it
 * (#6111), the flat arm carries it on the `section-divider` pseudo-field
 * (#6236), and `tabbed` joined them by copying it onto the tab `TabbedForm`
 * synthesises, where the renderer evaluates it (#6237). `wizard` is the
 * remainder.
 *
 * ⛔ The wizard's gap is a DESIGN boundary, not an oversight, and it is not one
 * copy line away. A step predicate would be step-boundary reactive against the
 * ruled live-record reactivity, and it needs navigation, indicator, final-gate
 * and re-selection semantics that the tab arm's machinery does not supply —
 * `WizardStepConfig` carries the full measurement. Until that contract is ruled,
 * an author who writes the key on a wizard is told so rather than watching it do
 * nothing.
 *
 * Single-sourced so the runtime report and the pin that holds its wording cannot
 * drift apart.
