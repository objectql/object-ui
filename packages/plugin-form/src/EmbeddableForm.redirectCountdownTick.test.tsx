 *
 * objectui#5083 — `EmbeddableForm`'s thank-you countdown must actually count
 * down.
 *
 * The panel's "Redirecting in {{seconds}} seconds…" line is documented, in
 * all ten locale packs (`packages/i18n/src/locales/*.ts`,
 * `publicForm.redirecting`), as showing "the remaining seconds". Before this
 * fix the number was computed exactly once — at the render that first shows
 * the panel — and never touched again: accurate the instant it was drawn,
 * then a static prop for the rest of the wait (a full, unmoving 3 seconds on
 * the default delay).
 *
 * A test asserting only that render would pass against BOTH the broken and
 * the fixed behaviour and pin nothing — see the reverse-verification section
 * below, where that is exactly what happens. This file's job is the half
 * that only the fixed behaviour can pass: the number genuinely decreasing,
 * once per second, while `EmbeddableForm` owns the interval driving it.
 *
 * ## Why this file fakes the clock, when the #5049 sibling deliberately does
 * not
 *
 * `EmbeddableForm.redirectTimerLifetime.test.tsx` keeps the real clock on
 * purpose: the submit path is a chain of awaited promises, and faking the
 * clock around it makes the observation race the promise resolution instead
 * of the delay. That reasoning is about `@testing-library/react`'s `waitFor`
 * / `findBy*`, which poll with a plain, timer-blind `setTimeout` — under
 * `vi.useFakeTimers()` that `setTimeout` never fires because the fake clock
 * never advances on its own, so those helpers would simply hang.
 *
 * `vi.waitFor` (vitest's own, imported as `vi.waitFor`, NOT
 * `@testing-library`'s `waitFor`) does not have that problem: its polling
 * loop is backed by the REAL, un-mocked timers (`getSafeTimers()` inside
 * vitest), and on every poll it checks `vi.isFakeTimers()` and advances the
 * fake clock itself before re-checking the callback. So the awaited
 * `dataSource.create(...)` in the submit handler still resolves on its own
 * microtask — fake timers never touch promises — while every timer this file
 * cares about (the countdown's `setInterval`, and the sibling navigation
 * `setTimeout` armed alongside it) is fully virtual and fully controllable
 * via `vi.advanceTimersByTime`. Every wait below uses `vi.waitFor` for
 * exactly this reason; `@testing-library`'s `waitFor`/`findBy*` are not used
 * once fake timers are installed.
 *
 * ## What this file deliberately does not touch
 *
 * WHETHER a destination is followed (`isRedirectUrlSafe` /
 * `allowedRedirectHosts`, objectui#4989) and WHETHER the navigation wait
 * itself is owned correctly (objectui#5049 / PR #5070,
 * `EmbeddableForm.redirectTimerLifetime.test.tsx`) are unchanged and pinned
 * elsewhere. Every fixture below uses a same-origin relative destination,
 * already accepted before this file's subject — the countdown DISPLAY —
 * begins.
 *
 * ## Reverse-verification (predicted BEFORE running, then measured)
 *
 * Reverting `EmbeddableForm.tsx` to compute the seconds once from
 * `pendingRedirect.delayMs` (dropping `useRedirectCountdownSeconds` and its
 * `setInterval`), with every test below kept as-is:
 *
 * 1. **`submitAndWaitForCountdown`'s own `expect(armed.length).toBe(1)`
 *    check goes red in all three tests** (the reverted code never calls
 *    `setInterval` at all, so `armed` stays empty forever and the assertion
 *    fails deterministically — no interval to wait for). This is the
 *    assertion that PINS the fix; nothing else in this file can even run
 *    once it fails.
 * 2. **The `vi.waitFor` immediately above it, asserting
 *    `Redirecting in 4 seconds`, stays GREEN on the reverted code** — the
 *    static one-shot text was already correct before this fix, which is
 *    exactly the "asserts only the initial render" trap the card warns
 *    about. Recorded here so that green is not miscounted as evidence for
 *    anything.
 * 3. Every subsequent decrement assertion (`3 seconds`, `2 seconds`,
 *    `1 seconds`, `0 seconds` and the self-clear) is unreachable on the
 *    reverted code — the suite fails at (1) before getting there — so they
 *    are not independently informative in THIS reversion; they are pinned by
 *    the fact that (1) already fails.
