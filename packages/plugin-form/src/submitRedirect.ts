 *
 * Where a form's `submitBehavior: { kind: 'redirect' }` sends the submitter
 * (objectui#4989), under the shape objectstack#7496 ruled on 2026-08-11 and
 * objectstack#7657 landed in `@objectstack/spec` (live on the 17.0.0 GA pin
 * this package depends on).
 *
 * The ruling has three points:
 *
 *   1. **relative paths only** — an absolute or protocol-relative URL is
 *      refused. This is the open-redirect face: the destination is authored
 *      metadata, which is exactly where an address somebody else chose gets
 *      copied in.
 *   2. **interpolation only from declared record fields**, spelled
 *      `{{record.field_name}}`, with every interpolated value **URL-escaped
 *      when the redirect is built**.
 *   3. a **verbatim redirect on the resolved relative path** is the intended
 *      consumption — the destination is that string with its tokens
 *      substituted, and nothing else.
 *
 * Point 1 is a property of the string, so the spec enforces it at the authoring
 * door and this module ASKS it rather than restating it. Whether
 * `{{record.foo}}` names a field the form's object actually declares needs both
 * the string and the object declaration, so `@objectstack/lint`'s
 * reference-integrity family owns that. Point 2's "when the redirect is built"
 * and point 3's consumption are runtime, and this module is where they happen.
 *
 * ## The shape verdict is the spec's, not a copy of it
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` does not export its url check as a function, but it does
 * export the schema the check lives in, so the verdict here is produced by
 * PARSING the smallest form view that carries this behavior. That costs one
 * parse per submit and buys the property that matters: there is no second
 * spelling of a security rule in this repo to drift from the first, and when the
 * ruling widens (it says an allowlist of absolute origins "waits for measured
 * demand") this package follows the pin with no edit here.
 *
 * The alternative was a local re-implementation of the seven refusal families
 * kept honest by a parity table. `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`
 * exists because this repo has paid for that shape four times
 * (objectstack#4115, objectui#4074/#4588/#4592): a hand copy passes every value
 * comparison right up to the release that moves the original.
 *
 * Parsing a MINIMAL view is load-bearing, not laziness. A whole stored
 * `FormView` refuses on any unrelated key the strict schema does not know, and a
 * redirect must not be refused because some other part of the metadata drifted.
 * The question asked here is narrow — "is this url a value the contract
 * allows?" — so only that value is submitted for judgement, and only issues on
 * that value's path are read back.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` is already a declared runtime dependency of this package
 * and already imported by its siblings (`sectionFields.ts`, `sanitize.ts`), so
 * the import adds no dependency and no chunk.
 *
 * ## Relationship to `apps/console`'s `submitRedirect.ts`
 *
 * `apps/console` consumes the same ruled key and got the same treatment in
 * objectui#4190 / PR #4992. The two are deliberately SEMANTICALLY aligned and
 * physically separate: a published renderer package cannot import an app's
 * module, and the shared thing — the shape verdict — is not duplicated at all,
 * because both ask the same `FormViewSchema`. What is written twice is the token
 * substitution and the escape, ~20 lines the spec exports no substituter for.
 *
 * Two deliberate divergences, both named so a future consolidation has a map.
 * The accepted value: the console resolves to a `path` it hands to a ROUTER,
 * whereas this package resolves to a `url` it hands to a browser-level
 * navigation, for the reason in {@link resolveSubmitRedirect}'s "what this module
 * does NOT fix". And the split: the console has since separated its shape verdict
 * into `checkSubmitRedirectUrl` because it also owns an authoring door
 * (`PublicFormsPage` asks it before saving), which this package has no
 * counterpart to — a renderer only ever consumes.

/**
 * The one interpolation the ruled `url` accepts, as a capture of the field
 * segment. The grammar (lowercase snake_case) is the one `object.fields` keys
 * are declared under, narrowed by the ruling to a FLAT segment under the
 * `record.` root — the record just submitted is the whole scope a post-submit
 * moment has.
 *
 * This spelling is the one place the spec's rule is restated rather than asked,
 * because substitution is the half of the ruling assigned to the consumer and
 * the spec exports no substituter. It is safe in one direction only, and that is
 * deliberate: it runs solely on strings the schema has already accepted, and
 * anything it fails to consume leaves a brace behind, which
 * {@link resolveSubmitRedirect} treats as a refusal. So a future divergence from
 * the spec's token grammar can only ever refuse a redirect loudly — never
 * navigate to a half-substituted URL.

/**
 * Resolve an authored `submitBehavior.url` into the relative destination to
 * navigate to, or refuse it.
 *
 * @param url    the authored value, exactly as the metadata carries it
 * @param record the record this submit just wrote — the token scope
 *
 * Refusal is fail-closed and quotable: the message is the spec's own
 * prescription (it names the key, the rule, and what to write instead, including
 * that a deliberately external destination is an app navigation item rather than
 * this key), so the author reads the same sentence here that the authoring door
 * would have told them. Callers must SHOW it — the write already succeeded, and
 * dropping the refusal leaves the submitter looking at a still-filled form with
 * no idea why nothing happened, which is objectui#4989's defect 2 and the one
 * outcome the ruling's consumer half rules out.
 *
 * ## Why substitution cannot widen the destination
 *
 * Every interpolated value goes through `encodeURIComponent`, which escapes the
 * characters that could add structure — `/` and `:`, along with `?`, `#` and the
 * rest. So a field carrying an address, a traversal, or a space becomes one
 * opaque segment or query value: a token is a VALUE in the path, never a way to
 * add path structure.
 *
 * That escape carries the whole weight of the property, and re-parsing the
 * result would NOT be enough on its own. Interpolated raw,
 * `/t/{{record.slug}}` with an address in `slug` becomes
 * `/t/https://evil.example/steal` — which still starts with `/` and carries no
 * leading scheme, i.e. a spec-VALID relative path pointing somewhere the author
 * never wrote. Relative-only is a rule about where a path STARTS, so it has
 * nothing to say about structure injected further along. `submitRedirect.test.ts`
 * therefore pins both halves.
 *
 * ## What this module does NOT fix: mount-blindness (objectui#4989 defect 4)
 *
 * An accepted value is a rooted relative path, and the caller hands it to
 * `window.location.assign`, which resolves it against the ORIGIN root. Under a
 * host mounted at a sub-path (the framework CLI configures one for every
 * embedded deployment) a ruled in-app `/thanks` therefore still leaves the app.
 * That is defect 4 of the card, and it is deliberately NOT addressed here:
 * fixing it means learning the host's mount, and every available mechanism
 * changes this package's published contract (see the escalation on
 * objectui#4989 — reading React Router's context requires importing
 * `react-router`, which this package declares in no dependency field and two of
 * its own consumers, `apps/site` and `packages/plugin-view`, do not have).
 * `submitRedirect.mountBlind.test.tsx` pins the measurement that escalation rests
 * on so the open defect stays visible instead of becoming folklore.
