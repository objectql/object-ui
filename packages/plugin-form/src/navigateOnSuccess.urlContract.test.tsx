 * objectui#5034 point 3 — the url contract for `navigateOnSuccess`.
 *
 * Points 1 and 2 (mount-blindness, and a refused destination reported as a plain
 * success) landed in PR #5558 and are pinned by
 * `navigateOnSuccess.mountSeam.test.tsx`. Those changed WHO travels and left
 * WHICH destinations are accepted byte-identical, deliberately, because the
 * acceptance set was ruled but not yet implemented. This file is that acceptance
 * set.
 *
 * ## The ruling being implemented
 *
 * Maintainer, 2026-08-17, recorded on the card, verbatim 「同意」:
 *
 *   "As a compat alias it runs under the os#7496 ruled semantics: relative-only
 *   (same-origin absolutes refused like any out-of-contract value), navigation
 *   through the injected seam ruled on #4989 once it lands (mount-aware), and the
 *   interpolated id URL-escaped."
 *
 * Three admissions follow, and each has its own block below: relative-only,
 * escaped interpolation, and the `{id}` / `{recordId}` dialect kept for existing
 * authors of this key (the compat half of the same ruling — the docs point new
 * authoring at `submitBehavior`, the code keeps honouring the old spelling).
 *
 * ## Why the two halves are pinned separately
 *
 * Relative-only is a rule about where a destination STARTS; escaping is a rule
 * about what a token may inject further along. Neither implies the other, and
 * `submitRedirect.ts` records the same split for the ruled sibling. The block
 * `neither half substitutes for the other` measures that directly: it drives one
 * value through each half and shows which assertion fires.
 *
 * ## Two properties asserted over a corpus rather than case by case
 *
 * 1. **No widening** (the card only ever narrows). Every destination this helper
 *    accepts must still be same-origin — the exact question the guard it replaces
 *    asked — so the reachable set can only have shrunk.
 * 2. **The deleted browser-navigation arm is unreachable.** Both call sites used
 *    to fork on `isAppRelativeDestination(nav)` and fall back to
 *    `window.location.assign`. That arm is deleted, and this is the proof it was
 *    dead rather than the argument that it should be: the real predicate is
 *    imported and asked about every accepted value.
 *
 * The same corpus does double duty as the drift detector for the deliberate
 * SECOND spelling of the relative test (`successBehavior.ts` does not import
 * `isAppRelativeDestination` — see its docblock for why the two keys must stay
 * free to diverge). If the two ever disagree, `the two predicates agree` goes red
 * on that day rather than silently moving this key's acceptance set.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — direction predicted before running, counts measured
 *
 * Mutation A, restoring the pre-ruling admission (`isSameOriginUrl(url)` in place
 * of the relative-only test), escaping left in place: RED on the same-origin
 * absolute refusals and on the corpus properties; the escaping and compat blocks
 * stay green because the escape is independent of the admission test.
 *
 * Mutation B, deleting the `encodeURIComponent` (interpolating the raw value),
 * relative-only left in place: RED on the escaping block. Direction worth
 * predicting rather than assuming: one of those cases goes red by turning
 * ACCEPTED-and-escaped into REFUSED (an id carrying an address, raw-interpolated,
 * stops being a relative reference), not by returning a differently-escaped
 * string. That is the asymmetry the two halves buy.
 *
 * Measured counts for both are recorded in the PR body.
