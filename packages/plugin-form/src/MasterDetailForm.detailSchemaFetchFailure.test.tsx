 *
 * `object-master-detail-form` must not show a PERMANENT "Loading columns…" for a
 * detail collection whose child-object schema fetch THREW (objectui#6372).
 *
 * ## The arm this covers, and why it is not the one objectui#6360 fixed
 *
 * `MasterDetailForm`'s detail-resolution effect has two arms that return an
 * entry with no `columns`:
 *
 *   1. `!d.childObject` — the objectui#5940 decline. Its render half landed in
 *      objectui#6360 as the `md-detail-no-child-object` config hint.
 *   2. `catch` — the schema fetch FAILED. This one.
 *
 * Arm 2's entry DOES name a child object, so it skips the config hint and falls
 * through to `Loading columns…`. That message never ends: the fetch that would
 * have supplied those columns already failed and is not retried.
 *
 * ## Why "no columns" cannot be the test
 *
 * ⭐ "Failed" and "still in flight" are represented IDENTICALLY on a plain
 * `MasterDetailDetailConfig[]` — both are simply an entry with no `columns`. An
 * assertion that keyed on the absence of columns would therefore fire for the
 * legitimately-pending detail too. The distinction only exists once the resolver
 * carries a per-entry resolution STATUS, which is what this card adds, so the
 * assertions below read the refusal placeholder that only the failed status can
 * produce — and the degenerate control at the bottom holds the loading branch
 * alive for the entry that really is still resolving.
