 * objectui#6059 — what `schemaDefaults.ts` publishes from the package ENTRY,
 * and what it deliberately does not.
 *
 * The card is a surface decision, so the surface is what this pins. Two names
 * became importable and the reason they travel together is that each one's
 * docblock names the other as its half: `omitServerResolvedDefaults` drops the
 * keys a CREATE payload must leave to the producer, `isRequiredInForm` excuses
 * those same fields from the client-side `required` rule, and a consumer able
 * to reach one but not the other can build the half-fixed state #4069 and
 * #5883 closed on the two form chains separately.
 *
 * ## Why the negative half is the load-bearing one
 *
 * "These two are exported" is proved by anything that imports them — the
 * console's `FormPage` does, and its own suite would go red without them. What
 * nothing else would notice is the OTHER direction: `schemaDefaults.ts` holds
 * five more names, and `export * from './schemaDefaults'` would have published
 * every one of them in a diff that looks tidier than the explicit list. Every
 * added name is published surface somebody then has to keep compatible, so the
 * withheld set is asserted rather than left to the reviewer's eye.
 *
 * `isRuntimeDefault` is withheld for a stronger reason than "nobody asked". It
 * belongs to `@object-ui/core` (it moved there in #4085 exactly so a third
 * consumer could read one answer); this module re-exports it for its own call
 * sites, and re-publishing it from a plugin entry would put a second spelling
 * of one classifier back into the workspace. The README says so too, in the
 * "`required` + a runtime default" section.
