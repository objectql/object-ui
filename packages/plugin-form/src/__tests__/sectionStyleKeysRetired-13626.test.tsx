/**
 * objectstack#13626 — the form-view section style keys are NOT consumed.
 *
 * ## The ruling this file pins
 *
 * `className` / `gridClassName` on the form-view section family sit on the
 * SDUI-only side of the authorable boundary: `@objectstack/spec` deliberately
 * does not declare them for these views (its `component.zod.ts` says so in
 * as many words) and the authorable-surface ledger carries no entry for them.
 * The renderer nevertheless reached them off the parsed view through `as any`
 * at seven sites — the boundary declared on one side and crossed on the other.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-09-01 (director decision batch C, verbatim「同意」):
 * **retire the reads**. Declaring the keys was weighed and NOT adopted — it
 * would formally invite free Tailwind strings into authored metadata, the exact
 * class the boundary exists to keep out, and per ADR-0065 / ADR-0080
 * (rev. 2026-06-30) utility classNames in runtime metadata are never scanned by
 * the build-time Tailwind, so they silently produce no CSS anyway.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is BEHAVIOURAL and not a source grep
 *
 * ⚠️ The retired reads did not actually need their casts. `ObjectFormSection`
 * (this repo's own `@object-ui/types`) still declares both keys, so a later
 * "cleanup" writing a plain `className: s.className` — no `as any` in sight —
 * type-checks and silently restores consumption. A grep for `as any` would stay
 * green through exactly the regression this file exists to catch. So each row
 * authors the keys and asserts the strings never reach the DOM.
 *
 * ## The liveness control — why every row asserts something PRESENT
 *
 * An "absent from the DOM" assertion is satisfied for free by a form that
 * failed to render, by a section that was never processed, and by a typo in the
 * mount. Each row therefore first waits on the section's own label: the
 * sentinel's absence is a verdict only once the node carrying it demonstrably
 * rendered. `columns: 2` is authored alongside for the same reason — it is a
 * sibling key on the same node that IS still consumed, so the section object
 * reaching the layout is not in question.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running)
 *
 * Restore the copy at any ONE of the seven sites and exactly the rows that
 * mount that arm go red in the PRESENT direction (the sentinel class reappears
 * in the markup); every other row stays green. Measured that way — see the PR.
 *
 * ## Scope boundary this file does NOT cross
 *
 * The form ROOT `className` (`ObjectFormSchema.className`, read as plain
 * `schema.className` and forwarded to the form wrapper) is a different key on a
 * different node and was NOT part of the ruling — it is deliberately unpinned
 * here. Rows below assert only the SECTION-level keys.
