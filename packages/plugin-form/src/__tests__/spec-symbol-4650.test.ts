/**
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form` ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision tripwire
 * (objectui#4650). Sibling of `spec-symbol-4650.test.ts` in plugin-grid,
 * plugin-calendar and plugin-kanban — one card, four packages, one verdict.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec/ui` owns `ObjectFormProps` from 17.0.0: it is the AUTHORED
 * props document of the `object-form` element (`z.input<typeof
 * ObjectFormPropsSchema>`), a serialisable authoring surface. This package's
 * same-named interface was the RENDERER's props — a live `dataSource` and the
 * component's own presentation keys — so the two are different things under one
 * word, and the local one was renamed to `ObjectFormComponentProps` rather than
 * derived. Same verdict and same suffix as `PageHeaderProps` ->
 * `PageHeaderComponentProps` (app-shell) and the `Record*ComponentProps` family
 * in `@object-ui/types`.
 *
 * See the plugin-grid sibling for why these are compile-time pins rather than a
 * runtime name probe, and why the "the spec still owns the old name" half of the
 * ratchet is not asserted before the pin reaches GA.
 *
 * Compiled by this package's `tsconfig.test.json` (objectui#3181) — without
 * that, every `Assert<…>` below is erased before vitest runs and proves nothing.
