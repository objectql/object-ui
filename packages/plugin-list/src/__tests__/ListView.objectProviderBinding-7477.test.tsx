/**
 * objectui#7477 — a react page binds ListView the way the published
 * `react-blocks` contract recommends, and it renders.
 *
 * Step 6 of #2890, released by the maintainer's ruling B on objectstack#14791.
 * The reported shape:
 *
 *     <ListView data={{ provider: 'object', object: 'x' }} type="kanban" />
 *
 * Both halves of that binding used to be INERT here, and silently so:
 *
 *   - `data.provider === 'object'` was read at ZERO sites in `ListView.tsx`
 *     (`provider === 'value'` and `provider === 'api'` are both live there, so
 *     the zero was a real gap and not a dead instrument). `schema.objectName`
 *     stayed undefined, `fetchData` returned early on `!schema.objectName`, and
 *     the page rendered an empty list with NO diagnostic — while the same
 *     metadata validates green against `@objectstack/spec`'s `ViewDataSchema`.
 *   - the author's `type` — which the react tier parks under `specType`,
 *     because the SDUI envelope claims the `type` key (ADR-0078,
 *     `components/renderers/layout/react-page.tsx`) — was read at ZERO sites in
 *     this package, so an absent `viewType` forced the view to `grid`.
 *
 * The fix is ONE fold in `normalizeListViewSchema` (`@object-ui/core`), not a
 * seventh per-block copy of the six sibling `data.object` reads and not a
 * renderer-side `??` dual-read (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * ## Why this file mounts the REAL react page tier
 *
 * The card's criterion is written about a react PAGE, and the `specType` park
 * only exists because that tier's wrapper puts it there. Asserting against a
 * hand-built `{ specType }` bag would pin this package's half against a shape
 * this file itself asserts — so the first test drives the real
 * `kind:'react'` compile, the real scope injection, the real `list-view`
 * registration and a spy under `object-kanban`, and the hand-built bag is kept
 * only as the narrower second case.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * drop either leg of the fold in `normalize-list-view.ts` and this file goes
 * red in a leg-specific way — without the `data.object` leg the kanban is
 * handed `objectName: undefined` and nothing is fetched; without the
 * `specType` leg the page renders `object-grid` instead of `object-kanban`.
 * The `provider: 'value'` case is the control that stays green either way.
 *
 * ## Dating the two query-absence controls (objectui#8705)
 *
 * `invents NO binding …` and `leaves the value provider alone …` each assert
 * that NO query is started. Read straight after their `waitFor`, that absence
 * was dated to MOUNT rather than to a settled load: on both of those paths the
 * view spy's props land on the FIRST commit, so `not.toHaveBeenCalled()` was
 * being evaluated before a deferred query could have run. Both pins stayed
 * GREEN against an implementation strictly worse than the bug — one line in
 * `ListView.tsx` that fires `dataSource.find` 50ms after every mount — so they
 * could not tell "starts no query" from "starts a query a tick later", which
 * is exactly the regression shape that would reach them.
 *
 * There is no anchor to prefer here, and that was checked before reaching for
 * a timer. An anchor needs a positive signal the implementation must emit
 * AFTER any query would have started. On the `value` path nothing settles at
 * all: `loading` is false from the first commit and never flips. On the
 * `object`-provider-without-object path the one transition that exists —
 * `loading` going false — is set from the very branch a query would start
 * from, so it postdates a synchronous query and not a deferred one. The
 * absence is therefore watched over a bounded window; see `ABSENCE_SETTLE_MS`.
 *
 * The other three absence reads in this file are NOT this shape, and that is
 * measured, not assumed: at `expect(gridProps).toHaveLength(0)` and at both
 * `expect(kanbanProps).toHaveLength(0)` sites, `dataSource.find` has ALREADY
 * been called when the line runs. Those three cases bind an object, and
 * `ListView` withholds the view spy behind its loading skeleton
 * (`loading && data.length === 0`) until the query resolves — so they are
 * already dated to a resolved query and are left exactly as they were.
