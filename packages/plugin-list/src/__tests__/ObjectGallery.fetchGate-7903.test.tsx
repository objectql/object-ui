 * objectui#7903 — `ObjectGallery`'s DUPLICATE query is gated.
 *
 * It sat outside the set objectui#6482 converged (`ObjectKanban`, `ObjectView`,
 * `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectTree`; `ObjectGantt` at objectui#7225 ask 2,
 * `ObjectTimeline` at objectui#7895) and nothing marked it a deliberate
 * exclusion. It held the object definition in a local `useState` and listed it
 * in the record-fetch effect's dependency array, so a mount issued TWO `find`
 * calls: one before the definition settled, with `buildExpandFields` seeing no
 * fields and therefore NO `$expand` at all, and one after.
 *
 * ⛔ A GREEN RUN WITH NO HOLD IS ZERO EVIDENCE HERE. This container settles the
 * metadata read and the record read close together, so several of the readings
 * below are invisible unperturbed — the lesson objectui#7466 paid for. The lever
 * is the METADATA fetch, so `getObjectSchema` is HELD and the writes into the
 * rendered card grid are counted per SINGLE mount. Measured on this component
 * with an instrumented renderer, `ObjectCalendar` as a positive control in the
 * same vitest run, holds 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/15/25/50/100 ms:
 *
 *   component       when     finds  expand sets        states  late  first paint
 *   ObjectGallery   before     2    [null, ['owner']]     2      3   flat 3-8ms
 *   ObjectGallery   after      1    [['owner']]           1      0   tracks hold
 *   ObjectCalendar  before     1    [['owner']]           1      -   tracks hold
 *   ObjectCalendar  after      1    [['owner']]           1      -   tracks hold
 *
 * ⭐ "First paint tracks the hold" is the signature that the gate is LIVE, and
 * it is what the ordering case below pins — not as a wall-clock threshold, which
 * would be a timing test, but as an ORDER: the definition resolves, then the
 * query goes out, then the card grid is written to, exactly once. Before the
 * gate that order was find, paint, definition, find, paint. Measured after the
 * gate: 9ms at a +3ms hold, 15ms at +10, 35ms at +25, 106ms at +100, against a
 * flat 3-8ms at every hold before it.
 *
 * ⚠️ This component's visible cost was a TWO-step paint, not the three-step one
 * `ObjectCalendar` (objectui#6453) and `ObjectTimeline` (objectui#7895) each
 * measured. Those make `loading` an unconditional early return, so the re-run's
 * `setLoading(true)` drops them back to their placeholder in between. Here the
 * early return is `loading && !items.length`, so once the raw rows are in state
 * the skeleton cannot come back — measured `skelAfter=false` at every hold. The
 * user saw raw foreign-key ids replaced IN PLACE by the expanded rows. Recorded
 * because objectui#6482's standard is that the cost is measured per component,
 * never inherited from a sibling with a matching shape.
 *
 * ⚠️ The gate is only safe because the resolution now SETTLES ON EVERY EXIT
 * (objectui#7232, via the shared `useSettledSchema`): the replaced effect
 * returned without settling on `!dataSource`, on a missing `getObjectSchema`, on
 * an absent object name and in its `catch`. That cost nothing while nothing
 * waited on it and would hold a gated query open FOREVER. The two middle cases
 * below are that trap, pinned: a gallery that never loads is the failure this
 * file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * ⛔ GATING IS NOT EXPANDING. objectui#7429 is the separate, non-overlapping
 * concern of whether the `$expand` set this query carries is FLS-gated, and
 * objectui#7390 is the unbounded fetch on this same component. This file asserts
 * only HOW MANY queries go out, WHEN, and whether the first one carries its
 * expansion.
