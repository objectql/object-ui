/**
 * objectui#7547 — switcher chrome around a single entry.
 *
 * `showViewSwitcher` reaches this component already decided, and both faces
 * that decide it compute the same wrong number: `app-shell/ObjectView` and
 * `app-shell/InterfaceListPage` count the LENGTH of
 * `appearance.allowedVisualizations`. That is the whitelist BEFORE this
 * component intersects it with the ADR-0047 capability gate — so a view
 * whitelisting `['grid', 'timeline']` with no timeline block whitelisted two,
 * resolved one, and drew the border / dropdown / separator cluster around a
 * Grid entry that could not switch to anything.
 *
 * Neither face can compute it: the gate that answers "does this type resolve?"
 * lives here, in `availableViews`. So the predicate is applied at the one site
 * holding both halves (`viewSwitcherOffered`), which is also why one change
 * covers BOTH doors.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DISCRIMINATING PAIR IS THE POINT. A fix that simply stopped drawing
 * the switcher would pass every "no chrome" case below, so each of them is
 * matched by a control that whitelists the SAME two types and DECLARES the
 * second one's binding — chrome must still be drawn there. The two arms differ
 * in exactly one thing: whether the whitelisted second type resolves.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `{showViewSwitcher && (` at the render site and the "no chrome" arms
 * go RED (the cluster reappears around one entry) while every control stays
 * GREEN in either world — a resolvable second type was always offered.
