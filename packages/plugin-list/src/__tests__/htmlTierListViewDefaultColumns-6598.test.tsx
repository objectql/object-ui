 * The reported page, end to end: a `kind:'html'` page whose `<list-view>` must
 * render DATA COLUMNS and not just the index column (objectui#6598).
 *
 * The production report (objectstack#12649, hotcrm, promo-video recon) tried
 * eight spellings of `columns` on an html-kind page and got the same picture
 * every time: the row count, the filter/group/sort toolbar, and "no data
 * columns at all — only the index column". Two of the eight were the grammar
 * cases objectui#6614/#6669 legalised (single-quoted arrays, bare identifier
 * object keys) and they render today; this file pins the one that was NOT a
 * grammar question and was the only one that failed with **zero diagnostics** —
 * declaring no `columns` at all and expecting the block's defaults.
 *
 * ## Why this file goes through the REAL grid
 *
 * `ListView.unauthoredColumnProjection-6598.test.tsx` pins the handoff — what
 * this component feeds the child grid — against a stub. That is the mechanism,
 * and it is not the symptom: the symptom is a `<th>` count, and it emerges from
 * ListView and ObjectGrid disagreeing about how "unauthored" is spelled. A stub
 * cannot see a disagreement it is standing in for. So this file mounts the real
 * page renderer, the real html-tier compile, the real `list-view` registration
 * and the real `object-grid`, and counts headers.
 *
 * Registered in `heavyDomTests` for the setup's `@object-ui/plugin-grid`
 * side-effect registration, the same route
 * `ListView.crossPageSelectAll.test.tsx` takes — a plugin-list → plugin-grid
 * import would be the heavier change.
 *
 * ⚠️ The assertions are deliberately "which business columns are present", not
 * an exact header list. When the grid owns the fetch it derives defaults from
 * the object schema (hidden and readonly system-managed fields dropped); when a
 * host like ListView owns it, the grid takes its inline-data branch and derives
 * them from the row payload's keys instead. That precedence is a separate,
 * open question against `packages/plugin-grid` and it moves the exact list —
 * it must not be able to move whether the page shows data columns at all.
