 * objectui#4163 part 1 — the anti-drift pin for the inline per-locale label
 * rule, and the guard that makes objectui#4163's second dispatch ruling
 * ("the layout sites use the spec's OWN label resolver — do not hand-roll a
 * resolution that can drift from it") safe where it could not be followed
 * literally.
 *
 * ## Why two resolvers exist at all
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6 widened `I18nLabel` from `string` to
 * `string | Record<string, string>` and shipped `resolveI18nLabel(label,
 * locale)` as the producer's rule for reading one. #4163 resolves that
 * vocabulary at thirteen sites, and they do NOT all reach for the same
 * function:
 *
 *  - `@object-ui/layout` and `@object-ui/app-shell` call the spec's
 *    `resolveI18nLabel` directly;
 *  - `@object-ui/plugin-list`, `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` and
 *    `@object-ui/plugin-designer` call objectui's `pickLocalized`, because
 *    those components sit inside objectui's i18n tree and already hold the live
 *    UI language — and `pickLocalized` answers `''` on a miss, which is what a
 *    text node wants, where the spec's answers `undefined`.
 *
 * Two functions over ONE vocabulary is exactly the drift the ruling names. The
 * harm is not a crash: it is the same authored map rendering one locale on the
 * runtime dashboard and a different one in the designer's preview of that same
 * dashboard, with every type and every other test still green. Nothing else in
 * either repo compares them, so this file is the comparison.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * The six limbs of the rule, in order — exact tag, base language, a regional
 * key sharing the base, `default`, `en`, then any entry — plus the pass-through
 * and empty-map edges, each asserted on BOTH functions from one table. A limb
 * that changes on one side and not the other fails here rather than in a
 * screenshot.
 *
 * The ONE remaining difference is normalized explicitly rather than hidden:
 * the spec's resolver reports a miss as `undefined` (so a caller's `?? name`
 * fallback chain can proceed), `pickLocalized` reports it as `''` (so a text
 * node renders nothing). `specForRender` states that conversion in one place;
 * if the two ever disagree about anything else, the table row fails.
 *
 * ## The two RULE divergences are gone as of objectui#3907
 *
 * They are recorded here because this file is where the claim "one difference"
 * has to stay true. `resolveI18nLabel` shipped (objectstack#6765) with two
 * documented departures from `pickLocalized`, both narrowings: it read **own
 * properties only**, and it applied the `typeof === 'string'` filter on **every**
 * limb rather than only on limbs 3 and 6. Neither was reachable by an input
 * `I18nLabelSchema` accepts, so both were filed as an observation
 * (objectui#3907) instead of a defect.
 *
 * objectui#3907 landed the same two guards in `pickLocalized`, so the rule
 * divergence is now **zero** and the surviving difference is purely the
 * miss SPELLING above — a return-shape choice each side's callers need, not a
 * disagreement about which entry to pick. The convergence is asserted, not
 * asserted-in-prose: `CONVERGED` below carries the exact vectors that used to
 * tell the two implementations apart, and every one of them is now answered
 * identically. If either side regresses, those rows fail here.

 * the only inputs that could ever have told the two ends apart, so they are the
 * only rows whose agreement is evidence rather than restatement.
 *
 * Note the expected answers are NOT `''`. A prototype-named locale, or an

 * chain continues to the next limb, so these resolve by the ordinary rule.
