/**
 * [#6455] The toolbar sort picker LISTS a platform-refused field it must never
 * PERSIST.
 *
 * #6108 gave the picker the served sortability signal (objectstack#10235
 * ruling A) for the RENDER leg — "should this control be offered?" — and kept
 * one deliberate exception: a field the CURRENT sort already names stays
 * listed, because that is the only way a user can REMOVE a sort the server
 * refuses outright. Withholding it unconditionally renders a blank row nobody
 * can delete.
 *
 * The picker then rendered and emitted from the SAME array. So an edit to a
 * DIFFERENT part of the sort — a second key, a direction, a reset — re-emitted
 * the refused entry, and the host turned that into `persistViewPatch({ sort })`:
 * a personalization PUT storing a column the platform answers
 * `400 INVALID_SORT` for, written by a user who never touched that row.
 *
 * ## What each test is holding down
 *
 * The two halves pull in opposite directions on one array, so neither half is
 * assertable alone: "the leak is closed" is trivially satisfied by a picker
 * that lists nothing, and "the entry is still listed" is trivially satisfied
 * by the leak. Every fix-direction test below therefore sits beside a control
 * that the naive fix (filtering the array the picker renders from) would fail:
 *
 *  - LEAK (fix direction) — an unrelated edit, and a reset, write a payload
 *    with the refused entry gone.
 *  - LISTED + REMOVABLE (control) — the refused entry is still offered while
 *    in use, and removing it persists the removal.
 *  - UNCHANGED (control) — a sort with nothing refused in it persists exactly
 *    as before, and a deployment that serves NO projection is untouched.
 *
 * The host is modelled as `ObjectView` writes it — `onSortChange` → a
 * `persistViewPatch({ sort })` spy — so what these tests read is the payload
 * that reaches stored view state, not an intermediate array.
