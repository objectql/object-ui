/**
 * Tab-preset operator lowering: `ViewTab.filter` → ObjectQL AST (#3470).
 *
 * `UserFilters` used to carry its OWN operator table (`specOperatorToAst`) —
 * the second hand-kept operator map in this package — and it had drifted: it
 * lowered `not_in`/`nin` to the SPACED `'not in'`, a spelling that appears in
 * no spec vocabulary. `isFilterAST()` refuses it and the wire answers `400
 * INVALID_FILTER`, so a tab preset written with the spec's own canonical
 * spelling produced an empty list plus an error the moment it was clicked.
 *
 * The table is gone. Lowering is now purely structural — all 19
 * `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` are already `VALID_AST_OPERATORS` members — with the
 * spec's OWN `normalizeFilterOperator` as the single exit, exactly as the write
 * side (`app-shell/views/viewFilterFold.ts`) and `@object-ui/core`'s saved-view
 * fold (#3431) do.
 *
 * These assertions pin the acceptance fact OFFLINE, using the spec's own
 * `isFilterAST` — the very predicate that gates the filter server-side — so the
 * fix cannot regress without a live backend in the loop. The corresponding LIVE
 * measurement (published `@objectstack/*@17.0.0-rc.2` + app-showcase) is
 * recorded on `normalizeTabPresets` and in the PR: `'not in'` → 400,
 * `not_in` → 200 with the 8 rows the `!=` baseline returns, and `before`/`after`
 * → byte-identical answers to `<`/`>` on both a `date` and a `datetime` field.
