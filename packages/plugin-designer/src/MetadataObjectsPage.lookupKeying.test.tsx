/**
 * objectui#6522 — `MetadataObjectsPage` keys its name lookups so that an
 * object whose name collides with `Object.prototype` is still reachable.
 *
 * Same construction defect the objectui#6489 / objectui#6240 family already
 * ruled on, in a third page. This file is `MetadataObjectsPage`; the sibling
 * `MetadataFieldsPage.fieldsMapKeying.test.tsx` holds the fields-map half.
 *
 * ## Two sites, one construction — and the consequential one is a READ
 *
 * SITE A — `handleObjectsChange`, the delete scan (the card's site).
 *   The lookup of the manager's NEW list was a plain object literal filled by
 *   assignment, and the delete scan asked `!nextByName[name]`. For an object
 *   named `constructor` that lookup answers out of `Object.prototype` and
 *   returns the `Object` function — truthy — so the object reads as "still
 *   present" and `client.reset('object', 'constructor')` never fires. The row
 *   disappears from the manager, no error is shown, the save reports success,
 *   and the object is still there after a reload. A silent no-op, not a
 *   refusal: the strongest evidence here is not the shape of the lookup but
 *   the object SURVIVING the round trip, which is what these tests assert.
 *
 * SITE B — `reload`, the raw-payload lookup keyed by object name.
 *   The same construction, one function over, failing on the write instead of
 *   the read: `byName[item.name] = item` for an object named `__proto__`
 *   invokes the prototype setter rather than creating a key. The entry never
 *   becomes an own property, so `Object.values(...)` never yields it and the
 *   object is invisible in the Object Manager — unlistable, uneditable,
 *   undeletable — while the server holds it happily. It also leaves that
 *   payload on the lookup's prototype chain, so later lookups for unrelated
 *   names (`label`, `icon`, `fields`, …) answer out of it.
 *
 * Both names are legal. Measured against the installed `@objectstack/spec`,
 * and pinned below in `the instrument` so this file does not merely assert
 * that the page handles a name the platform would have refused anyway.
 *
 * ## Why `Map` here and `Object.fromEntries` in the sibling
 *
 * The fields map in `MetadataFieldsPage` IS the serialised `fields` body of a
 * PUT, so it must remain a plain object and the family fix there is
 * `Object.fromEntries` + `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(...)` on every
 * read. Neither lookup in THIS file is ever serialised: site A is built, read
 * and discarded inside one callback, and site B holds raw payloads whose
 * VALUES are spread into a PUT body while the container itself never reaches
 * the wire. A `Map` has neither hazard structurally — a string key is just a
 * key, there is no prototype to answer out of and no setter to trip — instead
 * of requiring every future read in the file to remember a guard.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Fixture rule (objectui#6524)
 *
 * `{ __proto__: v }` in an object literal SETS THE PROTOTYPE (Annex B.3.1);
 * it does not add a key. A fixture written that way has zero own keys and
 * passes for the wrong reason. Every `__proto__` key in this file is spelled
 * `['__proto__']`, a computed key, and the rule itself is pinned below.
 * `JSON.parse` does define an own `__proto__` property, which is why the
 * server payloads this page reads (parsed bytes) carry the name honestly.
