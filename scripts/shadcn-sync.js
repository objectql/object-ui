/**
 * Fetch one registry URL and resolve its parsed JSON.
 *
 * Two failure modes used to resolve as if they had succeeded (objectstack#5803):
 *
 *  1. **A non-2xx response.** `https.get` emits `error` only for TRANSPORT
 *     failures. A 403 from an egress allowlist, a 502 from a CDN, a 404 from a
 *     moved endpoint — each arrives as a perfectly ordinary response whose
 *     *body* is the error text. Never looking at `statusCode` meant that text
 *     was handed back as though it were the component.
 *  2. **A 2xx that is not JSON.** The old code caught the `JSON.parse` throw
 *     and resolved the raw string instead, so an HTML interstitial flowed on to
 *     consumers that all read `data.files?.[0]?.content` and quietly saw
 *     `undefined` — the lenient read that hid the failure.
 *
 * Both now reject. Every caller already has an error path (`--check` marks the
 * component `error`, `--update` refuses to write); what they did not have was
 * anything telling them the fetch had failed at all.
 *
 * Redirects are deliberately NOT followed: a 3xx to a login or interstitial
 * page is the same class of poison. The registry endpoints are direct JSON, so
 * if upstream ever starts redirecting, this fails loudly with the status in the
 * message instead of ingesting whatever the redirect target serves.
 *
 * `get` is injectable so the tests can drive a real fixture server over plain
 * `http` — the status/parse logic under test is transport-independent.
 *
 * ## No response at all (objectstack#5968 / objectui#4031)
 *
 * The two failure modes above are both *response-shaped* — something came
 * back and was wrong. A black-holed connection (a dropped SYN, or a peer that
 * completes the TCP handshake and then never writes a byte) produces neither
 * `error` nor `end`; the request just sits there forever. `--check` fires 46
 * of these in series, so one hang stalls the whole command until whatever
 * wraps it (a CI job timeout, a person hitting Ctrl-C) gives up — with
 * nothing in the log naming which of the 46 URLs was the one that stuck.
 *
 * `req.setTimeout` is armed unconditionally and fires on `timeoutMs` of
 * inactivity on the request's socket. Node arms that idle timer as soon as a
 * socket is assigned to the request — which happens before the TCP handshake
 * resolves — so the same callback covers both a connection that never
 * completes and one that completes and then goes quiet; there is no distinct
 * "connecting" vs "connected" case to branch on here. On fire it calls
 * `req.destroy(error)`, which the existing `req.on('error', reject)` below
 * already catches (`destroy(error)` re-emits `error` on the request) — so the
 * timeout reuses the same rejection path as a transport failure, rather than
 * adding a second one. Deliberately no retry: a black hole does not resolve
 * itself in seconds, so retrying only doubles the worst-case wait while
 * every caller's error path already degrades gracefully (`--check` marks the
 * component, `--update` refuses to write).

/**
 * Fetch a registry entry, optionally serving it from the on-disk cache.
 *
 * ⚠️ `allowCache` controls READING only. Writes always refresh the entry, so a
 * command that must see live data (`--update`) still warms the cache for the
 * next `--check`.
 *
 * The read/write split is the safety property: read-only commands may answer
 * from a cached copy, but nothing that writes a component file ever does.
 * A stale `--check` is a mildly out-of-date status line; a stale `--update`
 * would put hour-old code on disk under a message saying it is current.
 *
 * ## Only registry data is ever cached (objectstack#5803)
 *
 * The cache used to store whatever `fetchUrl` resolved, which under an egress
 * block was the string `Host not in allowlist: ui.shadcn.com…`. All 46 entries
 * were written, and for the next hour every `--check` answered from them
 * without retrying — one moment of network trouble degraded the command for an
 * hour, while reporting "46 cached" as if all were well.
 *
 * So the entry is validated on BOTH sides of the disk:
 *
 * - **write**: only a response that passes `isRegistryEntry` is persisted. A
 *   rejected fetch or a junk payload leaves the cache untouched, so the next
 *   run retries for real.
 * - **read**: an entry that does not pass is not served, and is deleted. Read
 *   validation is what makes recovery immediate — a cache already poisoned by
 *   an older build (or by any future write path) is dropped on first contact
 *   instead of being trusted until its hour is up. Validating only on write
 *   would leave every existing poisoned tree serving garbage for the rest of
 *   its TTL, with no way to tell the user beyond "wait".
 *
 * `cacheDir` and `get` exist for the tests (a throwaway directory and a local
 * fixture server). Both carry real defaults rather than being left undeclared:
 * once `scripts/` is type-checked with `allowJs` (objectui#3494), a destructured
 * option with no default is absent from this function's INFERRED signature, so
 * passing it from a `.ts` caller is a hard error. Declaring the injection point
 * is the fix; suppressing it at the call site would not be.
 *
 * `timeoutMs` passes straight through to `fetchUrl` (see its doc comment for
 * why a black-holed connection is now bounded) — declared here too so tests
 * can drive it down to milliseconds without waiting out the real 10s default.
