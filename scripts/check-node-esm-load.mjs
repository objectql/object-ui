 * Every published ESM package must be loadable by Node's own resolver.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-node-esm-load.mjs --specifiers-only  (`pnpm check:esm-specifiers`)
 *       node scripts/check-node-esm-load.mjs                    (`pnpm check:node-esm-load`)
 * Exit: 0 = no un-ledgered package emits an unresolvable relative specifier,
 *           and (full mode) every entry the gate imported either evaluated or
 *           is named as a stated boundary (UNBUNDLED_NODE_UNSUPPORTED),
 *       1 = a finding, OR the gate could not build, OR it inspected too little
 *           to be asserting anything.
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#4538)
 *
 * `packages/react/dist/index.js` re-exported through EXTENSIONLESS relative
 * specifiers — `export * from './SchemaRenderer'`. Node's ESM resolver does not
 * extension-search relative specifiers (that is a CommonJS behaviour), so
 * importing the published entry under plain Node failed:
 *
 *     code: 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
 *     url:  'file:///.../packages/react/dist/SchemaRenderer'
 *
 * Nothing caught it because every consumer this repository exercises goes
 * through a bundler, and bundlers extension-search happily. The unbundled paths
 * — plain Node ESM, an SSR host importing the package directly, a consumer
 * running the published tarball without a build step — are the ones that break.
 *
 * ## Why it is a SOURCE defect, and what that buys the cheap leg
 *
 * The card was triaged as "a build/emit setting". It is not: `packages/react`
 * builds with a bare `tsc`, and **TypeScript never rewrites import
 * specifiers** — there is no emit flag that appends `.js`. What the source
 * writes is exactly what `dist` ships. The extensionless form was permitted
 * only because the root tsconfig sets `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`.
 *
 * That is what makes a CHEAP, per-pull-request criterion possible at all: for a
 * package whose build preserves specifiers, the emitted specifier IS the source
 * specifier, so the source can be judged without building anything. The
 * expensive artifact-level leg then exists to check that the cheap criterion is
 * the right one — see the two legs below.
 *
 * ## Two legs, because neither one alone is honest
 *
 *   1. SPECIFIER leg (`--specifiers-only`, no build, runs per pull request).
 *      For every published `"type": "module"` package whose build preserves
 *      specifiers, every relative specifier in a file the build emits must
 *      carry an explicit extension. Complete over the whole repository and
 *      instant, so a regression is caught the moment it is written.
 *
 *   2. LOAD leg (full mode, builds). Actually `import()`s each published entry
 *      in a child `node`, through the package's own `exports` map, with no
 *      bundler and no loader hooks. This is the leg objectui#4538 asked for by
 *      name, and the reason is measured rather than assumed: `plugin-charts`'
 *      own emitted entry was CLEAN, and the failure appeared only once
 *      evaluation crossed into `@object-ui/react`. A check that stops at
 *      RESOLUTION passes while the tree is broken, so this one evaluates.
 *
 * The legs disagree by construction, and that is the point. Leg 1 cannot see a
 * defect that reaches a package through a dependency; leg 2 cannot see a
 * defect on a code path evaluation does not take. Leg 1 is the ratchet; leg 2
 * is the proof that the ratchet guards the right property.
 *
 * Leg 2 also carries this repository's one PRODUCT boundary: three
 * style-carrying plugin packages that plain Node is not expected to load, ruled
 * permanent rather than owed. It is stated at length on
 * UNBUNDLED_NODE_UNSUPPORTED below — including what the boundary costs this
 * gate, and which leg guards those packages instead.
 *
 * ## The vacuous forms this gate must never take
 *
 *   - "Scan `dist/` if it exists." With no per-PR full-repo build `dist/` is
 *     usually absent, so such a gate passes because it looked at NOTHING. Leg 1
 *     therefore reads SOURCES, which are always present, and leg 2 BUILDS
 *     rather than hoping someone else did (`--no-build` exists for callers that
 *     just built, and is wired into nothing).
 *   - "Resolve the entry." Measured and rejected above: resolution succeeded on
 *     the very package the card was filed from.
 *   - "Import it and count the successes." A run where every package failed for
 *     an unrelated reason would report no findings of the gated class. So both
 *     legs assert their own SIZE — see MIN_PACKAGES / MIN_LOADED.
 *   - "Scan a text the gate MUTATED first." Leg 1 used to blank comments out of
 *     each source with two ordered regexes before matching specifiers in it,
 *     and the block-comment pass had no notion of already being inside a `//`
 *     line: a slash-star sequence in ordinary line-comment prose opened a
 *     comment that ran to the next star-slash anywhere in the file and blanked
 *     the live code between them. Measured on `main` at 478ec54ce — 2132
 *     specifiers seen by the mask, 2133 by the parser, the missing one a real
 *     `import`. Leg 1 now reads the file as written and asks the shared
 *     TypeScript scanner what the module edges are (objectui#5382); see
 *     `relativeSpecifiers`. `readTsconfig` below was the same class in the same
 *     file — three regexes over a tsconfig's raw text, blind to JSON strings,
 *     throwing on 61 of the repository's 91 configs — and took the same remedy
 *     under objectui#5367: TypeScript's own tsconfig reader.

/**
 * Parse a tsconfig, tolerating the comments this repository writes in them.
 *
 * ## Why this asks TypeScript rather than blanking comments (objectui#5367)
 *
 * It used to be three ordered `replace` calls over the raw text — blank block
 * comments, blank whole-line comments, drop trailing commas — feeding
 * `JSON.parse`. None of them knew what a JSON string was, so a slash-star
 * sequence written INSIDE a string opened a "block comment" that ran to the
 * next star-slash anywhere in the file and deleted every line between them.
 *
 * That is not exotic: `"@/*"` in a `paths` map and `"**\/*.test.ts"` in an
 * `exclude` list are the two commonest lines in this repository's tsconfigs,
 * and they are a matched opener and closer. Measured on `main` at ed35c23bb
 * over the 91 tsconfigs tracked by git: **61 of them threw**, not the two the
 * card was filed for. Every one of those throws was absorbed by
 * `effectiveNoEmit`'s catch, which grades an unreadable config as emitting — so
 * the gate's scope was being decided by a fallback rather than by a reading,
 * with no signal that it had happened.
 *
 * This is the same class as the specifier mask objectui#5382 retired further
 * down, and it takes the same remedy: ask the parser instead of pattern-
 * matching around it. `ts.parseConfigFileTextToJson` is TypeScript's own
 * tsconfig reader — comments, trailing commas and BOMs stop being questions
 * this gate has an opinion about, and the answer is by construction the one
 * `tsc` itself would compute. Re-measured with it: **0 of 91 throw**.
 *
 * No new dependency edge: `typescript` is a root devDependency and this module
 * already loads it on every run, transitively through the shared scanner it
 * imports from `check-phantom-dependencies.mjs`.
 *
 * Still THROWS on a genuinely unparseable config, deliberately — that is the
 * contract `effectiveNoEmit`'s conservative catch is written against, and the
 * contract `scripts/__tests__/check-node-esm-load.test.ts` asserts over every
 * tsconfig in the repository so this class cannot come back silently.

/**
 * Whether a package's build copies import specifiers through unchanged.
 *
 * A bare `tsc` does: TypeScript emits the specifier the source wrote. A bundler
 * (`vite build`, `tsup`) RESOLVES relative specifiers while bundling, so an
 * extensionless one in its source never reaches the artifact — measured:
 * `@object-ui/data-objectstack` has 10 extensionless specifiers in `src/` and 0
 * in its `dist/`.
 *
 * A `tsc` step that does not EMIT is excluded, and the emit question is settled
 * by reading the tsconfig rather than the command line. That distinction is not
 * academic: `@object-ui/console`'s build is `tsc && vite build && pnpm
 * build:plugin`, whose `tsc` step carries `"noEmit": true` — it type-checks, and
 * the artifact comes from the two steps after it. Grading it on the command
 * alone reported 124 findings against a package that emits none of them.
 *
 * A pipeline that runs an EMITTING `tsc` and a bundler counts as preserving: the
 * `tsc` half still writes files, and judging it is the conservative direction —
 * a false positive lands in the ledger with a reason, a false negative ships.
 * No published package matches that shape today; the rule is kept because the
 * shape is legal, not because something wears it.
 *
 * ## `@object-ui/fields` used to be this paragraph's example, and it was wrong
 *
 * It was named here as the emitting-tsc-plus-bundler case, and it is the
 * opposite: `packages/fields/tsconfig.json` inherits the root's `noEmit: true`
 * and its own comment says so in as many words — `tsc` CHECKS, `dist` is written
 * by vite-plugin-dts. The example survived only because `readTsconfig` could not
 * parse that file at all (objectui#5367): the throw hit `effectiveNoEmit`'s
 * catch, the catch answered "emitting", and the wrong answer got written down as
 * a fact about the package.
 *
 * Fixing the parse therefore MOVES this gate's scope, once, in one place:
 * `@object-ui/fields` leaves the specifier leg, 13 published specifier-
 * preserving ESM packages become 12. It is the only membership change in the
 * repository — `@object-ui/auth`'s config throws today too, but it declares
 * `"noEmit": false` outright, so its verdict is unchanged and merely stops being
 * an accident.
 *
 * Letting it drop is deliberate, and it costs no coverage. Measured at ed35c23bb:
 * `fields`' sources carry 0 extensionless relative specifiers, so no live finding
 * leaves with it; its built `dist` carries 0 extensionless out of 155 relative
 * specifiers, because rolldown resolves them while bundling, so the property this
 * leg ratchets is not observable in what `fields` publishes. And the sources keep
 * a STRICTER guard than this heuristic: that tsconfig pins `"moduleResolution":
 * "nodenext"`, under which a missing relative extension is TS2835 and a bare
 * directory import is TS2834 — the compiler rejects in `fields`' own build step
 * what this leg would only have reported.

// ── the ledger ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Packages measured to carry this defect that objectui#4538 did NOT fix.
 *
 * **Empty — every measured package has been cleared.** objectui#4538's own
 * scope was `@object-ui/react` plus the dependency closure its entry evaluates
 * through (`types`, `core`, `i18n`) — without those three the card's own
 * package stayed unloadable, so they were in scope by necessity rather than by
 * choice. Seven more packages carried the identical defect and were left for
 * their own cards: six (`auth`, `collaboration`, `fields`, `mobile`,
 * `permissions`, `providers`) were cleared under objectui#5214, and
 * `app-shell` — an order of magnitude larger than any of them, and split off
 * for its own card — under objectui#5357.
 *
 * An empty ledger is not a formality: while a name sat here the specifier leg
 * was a RATCHET, and with none it is a HARD REQUIREMENT. Any extensionless
 * relative specifier in any specifier-preserving package now fails the run on
 * the pull request that writes it, with no grandfathering left to hide behind.
 * Re-adding a name is therefore a deliberate act that owes a card and a reason,
 * not a way to get a red run green.
 *
 * It stays a ratchet in the other direction too: a package named here that is
 * now clean is itself a FINDING — the entry must be deleted in the commit that
 * fixes it, so the ledger cannot outlive the debt it records.
 *
 * Deliberately no per-package counts. This repository has been bitten by
 * hand-maintained numbers that nothing recomputes (see the note in
 * `.github/workflows/lint.yml`); a count here would go stale on its own clock
 * and still read as authoritative. The consequence is stated rather than
 * hidden: growth INSIDE an already-ledgered package is not caught. Those
 * packages are red-listed already, and the entry is removed only when the
 * package reaches zero.

 */
export const SPECIFIER_DEBT = new Map();

/**
 * Packages whose published entry cannot evaluate under plain Node, and for which
 * that is a STATED PRODUCT BOUNDARY rather than a debt anyone intends to pay.
 *
 * Kept separate from SPECIFIER_DEBT on purpose: an entry here answers a
 * DIFFERENT question (is an unbundled consumer supported at all?), and merging
 * the two would let this gate become a grab-bag in which the defect it exists
 * for stops being visible.
 *
 * Formerly `LOAD_DEBT`, renamed by the ruling below. A map whose name says
 * "debt" reads as a promise to fix, and these three entries are not one — the
 * old name is what made the ledger aspirational rather than honest. The
 * previous spelling survives in `packages/app-shell/CHANGELOG.md`, which
 * records the day that entry was added; this is the map it names.
 *
 * ## The boundary, and who ruled it
 *
 * **Unbundled Node consumption is NOT supported for style-carrying plugin
 * packages.** Ruled on objectui#5384 (2026-08-20), taken over the three
 * packages as a group rather than one at a time, exactly as the card asked.
 * The maintainer accepted the triage batch verbatim: 「其他接受你的建议。」
 *
 * The card put three directions on the table — move the stylesheet import off
 * module scope so the entry loads, declare the boundary, or something
 * upstream-shaped for `react-grid-layout` / `maplibre-gl` — and the ruling took
 * the second, with its reason recorded: *"No known unbundled-Node consumer
 * exists; converting a zero-pull capability gap into permanent maintained
 * machinery is the shape the startup rule rejects."*
 *
 * That premise was re-measured when this ledger was reworded, not inherited.
 * Every consumer of these three packages in this repository reaches them
 * through a bundler: `vite` in `apps/console`, `examples/console-starter` and
 * `examples/byo-backend-console`, and Next's `transpilePackages` in `apps/site`
 * — which is the key that makes the stylesheet work there. Nothing declares
 * them under `serverExternalPackages`, so Next's Node side never loads these
 * entries itself either, and the sibling `objectstack` repository names them
 * only in comments and changeset fixtures. Zero unbundled-Node consumers, and
 * the searches that returned zero were counter-probed with terms known to be
 * present.
 *
 * Revisit ONLY on a real consumer request, which reopens objectui#5384 as a
 * DESIGN card rather than a debt payment: the question to re-answer is whether
 * these packages should carry their stylesheet at module scope at all, and it
 * needs the consumer's shape to answer.
 *
 * ## What each entry excuses, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * All three die on the same code, and it is not this gate's defect class:
 * `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`. Resolution SUCCEEDS — both stylesheets are
 * exported by their own packages — and evaluation fails, because Node has no
 * loader for `.css` at all. Measured directly under Node 22.22.2:
 *
 *     TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".css"
 *       for …/react-grid-layout/css/styles.css
 *     TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".css"
 *       for …/maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css
 *
 * ## What the boundary costs, stated here rather than discovered later
 *
 * This map matches by PACKAGE NAME, not by error code, so the load leg cannot
 * speak for these three AT ALL: a genuine extensionless-specifier regression in
 * any of them would print as a boundary line here instead of failing the run.
 * That was true while they were debt and it is true now — permanence just makes
 * it permanent, so it is written down instead of remembered.
 *
 * What carries the guard instead is the SPECIFIER leg, which became a hard
 * requirement the moment SPECIFIER_DEBT emptied, and the ruling keeps it there
 * deliberately. It is measured, not hoped: objectui#5357's ablation reverted
 * app-shell's specifiers and watched the specifier leg redden while the load
 * leg went on printing a ledger line.
 *
 * An entry here is therefore never a way to turn a red run green. It owes what
 * these three pay: the boundary in words, the ruling that made it permanent,
 * and the consumer question it answers — a bare name would be a mystery to
 * whoever reads it next. `check-node-esm-load.test.ts` pins that every entry
 * cites a ruling, so an unexplained one fails the suite.
 *
 * The ratchet in the other direction is kept exactly as it was: a package named
 * here whose entry DOES load is a finding, because from that moment the
 * exemption costs coverage and buys nothing.

/**
 * Every relative module specifier a source file names, read from the PARSER.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a regex any more (objectui#5382)
 *
 * It used to be one, over a source that a `withoutCommentedCode()` helper had
 * blanked comments out of. That helper blanked BLOCK comments first, with a
 * pattern that had no notion of already being inside a `//` line, so any slash-
 * star sequence occurring in ordinary line-comment prose opened a comment that
 * ran to the next star-slash anywhere in the file — blanking every line in
 * between, live code included.
 *
 * That is not exotic prose. A line comment naming a package glob, a path
 * pattern or a wildcard import is ordinary here, and one such comment in
 * `packages/app-shell/src/preview/DraftChangesPanel.tsx` hid the real `import`
 * eight lines below it. Re-measured on `main` at 478ec54ce, over the 805 files
 * of the 13 specifier-preserving packages: the regex found 2132 relative
 * specifiers and the TypeScript parser found 2133 — one live import invisible
 * to a leg that has been a HARD REQUIREMENT since SPECIFIER_DEBT emptied, which
 * is the direction that ships a broken artifact behind a green run.
 *
 * The fix is not a cleverer pattern. A pattern cannot answer "am I inside a
 * comment", and the two `replace` calls whose ORDER decided the answer were the
 * defect. Asking the parser removes the whole class at once: comments, strings,
 * template literals and regex literals stop being questions this gate has an
 * opinion about. `readTsconfig()` above was a SEPARATE live instance of the same
 * class — regexes over a tsconfig's raw text, deliberately left for its own card
 * — and it is closed the same way, by TypeScript's own tsconfig reader
 * (objectui#5367).
 *
 * ## Why the sibling gate's scanner rather than a second parser
 *
 * `moduleSpecifiers()` is `check-phantom-dependencies.mjs`'s TypeScript-backed
 * scanner, already shared with `check-package-self-import.mjs` for the reason
 * that applies here too: three gates that each decide for themselves what a
 * module edge IS will eventually disagree, and the one that drifts stops
 * covering a form without anybody noticing.
 *
 * ## The line number is the SPECIFIER's, not the statement's
 *
 * `moduleSpecifiers()` reports where the STATEMENT starts, which is the right
 * answer for a gate asking "which package does this file name". This one prints
 * a line a reader is expected to jump to and check against `tsc`, and `tsc`
 * reports the error at the specifier — measured, for an import whose statement
 * opens on line 6 and whose specifier sits on line 8:
 *
 *     src/index.ts(8,8): error TS2835: Relative import paths need explicit file
 *       extensions in ECMAScript imports when '--moduleResolution' is 'node16'
 *       or 'nodenext'. Did you mean './a.js'?
 *
 * The two disagree for 255 of this repository's 2066 relative import/export
 * specifiers — 12.3%, by up to 7 lines. The retired regex matched at `from`,
 * which shares the specifier's line, so it was accurate and this must not
 * regress: a gate whose line numbers do not match the compiler's teaches the
 * reader to stop trusting them. (That lesson was paid for once already, by a
 * block-comment strip that moved every finding in `packages/react/src/index.ts`
 * six lines up — the license header.) Verified by construction: over all 2132
 * specifiers the old method could see, the new one reports the identical
 * specifier-and-line pair for every single entry.
 *
 * The literal is LOCATED, never re-parsed. The AST has already decided that
 * this statement carries this specifier, and an import or export declaration
 * holds no other string literal, so the first occurrence of the quoted text at
