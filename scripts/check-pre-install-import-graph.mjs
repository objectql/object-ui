/**
 * check-pre-install-import-graph -- every `scripts/` gate a workflow step runs
 * BEFORE `pnpm install` must load without `node_modules`.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-pre-install-import-graph.mjs
 *   node scripts/check-pre-install-import-graph.mjs --list
 *   node scripts/check-pre-install-import-graph.mjs --self-test
 *
 * ## The property, and why it is worth a gate (objectui#6148)
 *
 * A handful of this repository's gates deliberately run before any install:
 * they read the checkout and nothing else, which is what lets them run
 * UNFILTERED on every pull request shape for the price of a checkout plus one
 * `node` call. `docs-links.yml`, `skills-paths.yml`, `control-bytes.yml` and
 * `changeset-presence.yml` exist in that shape on purpose -- their headers each
 * say a gate a markdown-only PR cannot start "rebuilds the hole it exists to
 * close".
 *
 * The property that arrangement depends on is narrow and unwritten: each of
 * those scripts' WHOLE STATIC IMPORT GRAPH has to be node builtins plus
 * repo-relative modules, with nothing anywhere in it needing `node_modules`.
 *
 * A violation is invisible everywhere it could be caught cheaply:
 *
 *   - not a type error -- `tsc -p tsconfig.scripts.json` is happy with a
 *     package import;
 *   - not a lint error -- the package is a real dependency of the repo;
 *   - not a local failure -- locally `node_modules` exists, so it runs fine;
 *   - not a test failure -- until this gate, exactly ONE of the pre-install
 *     scripts had a test asserting it.
 *
 * It surfaces only as `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in a CI job, on whichever pull
 * request happens to touch the file. And for the four gates above, whose whole
 * point is running on shapes that skip installs, that is a gate that STOPS
 * RUNNING rather than a gate that fails loudly -- the failure direction
 * AGENTS.md names as worse than no verifier at all.
 *
 * The class is live rather than theoretical: objectui#6092's PR 2 changed
 * `check-doc-component-types.mjs` -- the single pinned one -- and its test went
 * red immediately, on a change that was in fact still install-free. The same
 * change to any of the others would have produced nothing.
 *
 * ## Two design decisions, and the defect each one prevents
 *
 * **The population is DERIVED from `.github/workflows/`, never hard-coded.** A
 * hard-coded list of scripts rots the first time someone moves a step above
 * `pnpm install` -- which is exactly the edit that needs catching. So this gate
 * parses every workflow, and for every job compares each step's index against
 * the index of the first `pnpm install` step IN THE SAME JOB. Move a step
 * above an install and the population grows on the next run; move one below and
 * it shrinks. objectui#6135 landed the same lesson one layer over: the
 * enumeration is the thing that rots.
 *
 * **The check walks the whole graph, not the entry file's own import lines.**
 * The assertion this gate generalises read one file's imports and required each
 * to start with `node:`. That is too narrow in one direction -- a relative
 * import of a builtins-only local module is fine, and two gates here spell
 * their builtins bare (`from "fs"`), which is equally install-free -- and too
 * weak in the other, because it cannot see a package pulled in ONE HOP AWAY.
 * Measured: adding `import ts from 'typescript'` to `scripts/invoked-as.mjs`
 * reddens the graph walk and is invisible to any own-imports-only form. Since
 * objectui#6092 every one of these scripts imports `./invoked-as.mjs`, so one
 * hop away is where the next breach will come from.
 *
 * ## Why static, and not a resolver hook
 *
 * The runtime alternative -- load each script under a `module.register` hook
 * that throws on any specifier needing `node_modules` -- was the right ad-hoc
 * instrument for the one-off measurement in objectui#6092, and is the wrong one
 * for a gate that runs on every pull request: it EXECUTES module top level.
 * These files are CI gates; several of them spawn `git`, read the whole tree,
 * or `process.exit`. A gate that runs nine other gates to decide whether they
 * could run is a much larger blast radius than the question deserves.
 *
 * ## This gate satisfies its own rule, by construction
 *
 * `pre-install-import-graph.yml` runs this file before any install, so this
 * file is IN its own derived population and walks itself. Its graph is
 * `node:fs`, `node:module`, `node:path`, `node:url`, plus `./invoked-as.mjs`
 * and `./js-comment-mask.mjs`, whose own graphs are builtins only. Nothing here
 * may grow a package import without the gate reporting itself -- which is the
 * intended arrangement, not a coincidence to be preserved by hand.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT judged
 *
 * Non-`node` pre-install steps (a `bash scripts/*.sh`, a `uses:` action) have
 * no JavaScript import graph and are not in the population. And this gate never
 * REPAIRS anything: it installs the floor. A script that needs a package must
 * move below the install in its workflow, or lose the package.

 *
 *   - `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` (`ci.yml`'s `e2e` job) installs a
 *     BROWSER, not the workspace. The package-manager anchor is what excludes
 *     it, since `playwright` is not `pnpm`.
 *   - `git config merge.pnpm-merge.driver "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile"`
 *     CONFIGURES a merge driver; it installs nothing. The command-position
 *     anchor is what excludes it -- the `pnpm` there is inside an argument.
 *
 *     ⚠️ Formerly `changeset-release.yml`, where that step sat ahead of the job's
 *     real install. It was removed with the dead CI half of the lockfile merge
 *     driver (objectui#6436, ruled 2026-08-27), so NO live in-repo instance of
 *     this shape remains. This is the SECOND re-pointing of the example -- PR
 *     objectui#6389 moved it here when `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` lost its copy

 *     as the synthetic fixture in the `does not read an install out of a shell
 *     comment or a quoted argument` case of
 *     `scripts/__tests__/check-pre-install-import-graph.test.ts`, cited by test
 *     NAME rather than line number on purpose (objectui#6998 records a
 *     cross-file citation in this repo that had rotted 86 and 107 lines off).
 *     ⛔ Do not drop the anchor because its example went away: it is the reason
 *     the boundary is drawn at a command position, and a quoted `pnpm install`
 *     can reappear in any workflow at any time.
 *
 * Getting that second one wrong would move the install boundary to step 4 and
