/**
 * check-element-data-source-declaration -- a block that WRAPS the runtime gate
 * must go through the seam that DECLARES the key the gate reads
 * (objectui#6678).
 *
 *   node scripts/check-element-data-source-declaration.mjs          # the verdict
 *   node scripts/check-element-data-source-declaration.mjs --list   # the sites
 *
 * ## What this is the mechanical half of
 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` is the spec's per-element data binding and
 * the one spelling that resolves a saved view for an object-bound block. It is
 * READ by `ElementDataSourceGate` in `@object-ui/react` on behalf of every block
 * that wraps itself in the gate. It was DECLARED by none of them, so the html
 * tier reported the one key that works with the same `unknown-prop` warning it
 * gives the spellings that do nothing -- on the tier built to accept AI-authored
 * pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract.
 *
 * The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 took option B **in the injection form**:
 * the declaration is emitted mechanically at the wrapping seam, from the same
 * place that reads the key, rather than hand-written once per block. Nine
 * hand-kept copies is what that ruling refused -- copies drift, and the tenth
 * block forgets.
 *
 * The emission is `Registry.register` -> `withElementDataSourceInput`, keyed on
 * the renderer having passed through `elementDataSourceBlock()`. That is one
 * mechanism and one copy of the declaration. What it cannot do by itself is
 * notice a block that starts wrapping the gate WITHOUT passing through the seam
 * -- and that block would publish a page-authoring surface missing the one key
 * its own runtime honours, silently, exactly as before. So the "cannot forget"
 * half is this gate: wrapping the gate and skipping the seam is a red build, not
 * a discovery six months later.
 *
 * ## The rule, and why it is stated over FILES
 *
 * A source file that CONSUMES the gate must also call `elementDataSourceBlock(`.
 *
 * "Consumes" is wider than the JSX tag on purpose, and that width was measured
 * rather than guessed: `element:record_picker` reads the binding through
 * `useElementDataSource` and renders the gate's own status panels WITHOUT the
 * `<ElementDataSourceGate>` wrapper -- its object lives under `properties`, so
 * there is no schema key for the gate to write. A rule that only knew the tag
 * would have declared that file compliant while it published exactly the defect
 * this work closes. It was found by the render probe in
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/element-data-source-input-injection.test.tsx`,
 * which detects the gate's panels and does not care how they got there, and the
 * rule here was widened to the family the probe actually sees.
 *
 * Prose does not count: the population is read through
 * `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs`, the tree's one answer to "comment, or code?".
 * Three modules discuss `useElementDataSourceSchema` in docblocks without
 * consuming it, and a naive reader would have demanded the seam from all three.
 *
 * File granularity is deliberate and it is the honest limit of a static reader:
 * matching a particular use site to the particular renderer that encloses it
 * needs a TypeScript parse, and a reader that guesses would fail in the
 * direction that matters (a wrong pairing reads as compliance). A file that
 * consumes the gate twice and marks once is therefore NOT caught here -- it is
 * caught by the render probe above, which reads the LIVE registry and needs no
 * parsing at all. The two together are complete; neither is alone.
 *
 * ## Both zeroes are loud
 *
 *   - a file wraps the gate and never reaches the seam  -> exit 1
 *   - ZERO gate-wrapping files found                    -> exit 2. "All
 *     compliant" over an empty population is green for nothing, and this reader
 *     going blind (a rename, a moved package root) looks exactly like a repo
 *     that stopped using the gate.
 *   - the DEFINING package is excluded, and the exclusion is asserted to
 *     exclude something AND to be incapable of hiding a consumer: a filter that
 *     matched nothing would leave the definition sites in the population and
 *     demand they mark themselves, and one that matched too much would silently
 *     stop checking. `@object-ui/react` registers no component, so anything it
 *     excludes cannot be a registration this gate is about -- and that premise
 *     is CHECKED rather than trusted.
