/**
 * No package may name ITSELF in a module specifier inside its own `src/`.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-package-self-import.mjs   (also `pnpm check:self-import`)
 * Exit: 0 = no package imports itself by name, 1 = at least one does, or an
 *       exemption below has gone stale
 *
 * ## The failure this closes (objectui#4801, first paid by PR #4789)
 *
 * PR #4789's first CI run had exactly one red check, `Type Check`:
 *
 *     cascadeOptionWidgetTypes.reexport.test.tsx(30,82):
 *       error TS2307: Cannot find module '@object-ui/fields'
 *
 * The file sits in `packages/fields/src/` and imported `@object-ui/fields` —
 * its OWN package name. That resolves, legally, through the package's own
 * `exports` map, which points at `./dist/index.d.ts`. And `turbo.json` gives
 * `type-check` `dependsOn: ["^build"]` — the DEPENDENCIES' builds, never the
 * package's own. So on a cold CI cache the declarations the specifier resolves
 * to have not been produced yet, and the file that reads as ordinary fails to
 * compile.
 *
 * ## Why a human process cannot catch it, which is why it is a gate
 *
 * Every local workflow builds before it type-checks, and
 * `pnpm --filter '<pkg>^...' build` builds the dependency closure — which, for
 * any package that is also somebody else's dependency, leaves a `dist/` behind.
 * The self-import then resolves against a stale artifact and the tree is green
 * on every machine that has ever run a build. The failure is visible ONLY on a
 * cold cache, i.e. only in CI, and it costs a full CI round plus a rework round
 * every time. Reproduced deliberately for objectui#4801: in a fresh worktree
 * with only the dependencies built (`packages/fields/dist` confirmed absent),
 * the self-import spelling exits 2 with the message above verbatim and the
 * relative spelling exits 0.
 *
 * ## Why the relative spelling is not a downgrade
 *
 * A package's own name and a relative path into its own `src/` are the SAME
 * module here, on both surfaces that read it: the repo-root `vitest.config.mts`
 * aliases each `@object-ui` package name to that package's own `src` directory,
 * and every consumer inside the package compiles from source. (A glob spelling
 * that pairing would close this block comment early — the trap
 * `tsconfig.scripts.json` documents, hit once while writing this file.)
 * Nothing about an assertion's meaning changes;
 * what changes is that the specifier stops depending on an artifact whose
 * existence nothing ordered. It is also strictly more honest — a file inside
 * the package is not a consumer of the package, and spelling it as one hides
 * that it is reading its own source either way.
 *
 * ## AST, not a regex, and the specimens that decide it
 *
 * The scan reuses `scripts/check-phantom-dependencies.mjs`'s TypeScript-backed
 * `moduleSpecifiers()` rather than growing a second parser, for two reasons
 * that are measurable in this repository right now:
 *
 *   - A package name inside a STRING LITERAL is not a module edge, and this
 *     repo has several. `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/perm-home-namespace-3546.test.ts`
 *     carries `"import { useObjectTranslation } from '@object-ui/i18n'"` as
 *     fixture TEXT; `packages/layout/src/__tests__/side-effects-manifest.test.ts`
 *     assigns `'@object-ui/layout'` to a const it writes into a temp entry file
 *     to bundle. A regex matching `from '<name>'` flags the first; both are
 *     correct code. An AST walk sees neither, because neither is an import.
 *   - The five forms that make a module edge — `import`, `export … from`,
 *     `import x = require()`, `import('…')` (value and type position) and
 *     `require()` — are all read. A gate seeing only `import` is satisfied by
 *     rewriting the import as a `require`, and the self-import would resolve to
 *     `dist` exactly as before.
 *
 * Sharing the parser also means the two gates cannot disagree about what a
 * module edge IS, which is the sort of drift that makes one of two gates quietly
 * stop covering a form.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated so it is not mistaken for more
 *
 *   - `src/**` of every workspace package under `packages/`, `apps/` and
 *     `examples/`. The roots come from the sibling gate's `PACKAGE_ROOTS` so the
 *     two cannot disagree about where packages live; `examples/` is added HERE
 *     because the property is about `type-check` racing a build, not about
 *     publication — three example packages carry both a `type-check` script and
 *     a `src/`, so the same race reaches them. The sibling gate excludes them
 *     because its question ("is this declared for a consumer") only applies to
 *     what is published, which is a different question.
 *   - Membership is NOT filtered by the changeset release group, for the same
 *     reason: an unpublished package still type-checks, and still has no
 *     dependency edge on its own build.
 *   - Files outside `src/` — `vite.config.ts`, a package's own `scripts/`,
 *     `apps/console/plugin.ts` — are not read. Those run through a bundler or a
 *     different program, where the package name may be exactly the right
 *     specifier.
 *   - WHERE a self-import resolves is not re-derived per package. It resolves
 *     to `dist` through `exports` unless some tsconfig `paths` entry redirects
 *     it, and a gate that accepted "there is a paths entry today" would be
 *     accepting the workaround as the fix — `packages/components/tsconfig.test.json`
 *     carried exactly such an entry until objectui#4801 removed it with the
 *     import it existed for.
 *
 * ## The exemption shape
 *
 * `SELF_IMPORT_EXEMPTIONS` is keyed by repo-relative file path and names the
 * specifiers that file may keep, with the reason. It exists for the one form
 * objectui#4801 named as legitimate: a file that reads the PUBLISHED artifact on
 * purpose (a packaging pin — "what a consumer resolves"), where the package name
 * is the point rather than an accident. It is EMPTY today, which is a
 * measurement and not an aspiration: all five self-references the phantom-deps
 * report counted were triaged for objectui#4801 and none was of that form.
 *
 * An exemption is re-derived on every run, the way `HOST_PROVIDED` and
 * `BUNDLED_APPLICATIONS` are in the sibling gate: an entry whose file no longer
 * holds that self-import, or that carries no written reason, is reported as
 * `stale-exemption` and fails the gate. An exemption is worth exactly what its
 * evidence is worth, and one that outlives its site silently widens the hole.
