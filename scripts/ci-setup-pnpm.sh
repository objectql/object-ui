#   bash scripts/ci-setup-pnpm.sh              # what every workflow runs
#   bash scripts/ci-setup-pnpm.sh --self-test  # exercises the retry itself
#
# ## What went wrong, and why it is not one workflow's problem
#
# On PR #8091 -- a one-file `skills/**` prose diff -- the required check
# `README Export Check` went red ten seconds into the job, before any gate logic
# ran. The whole failure was Corepack fetching the pinned pnpm tarball from
# `registry.npmjs.org`, dying inside undici with
# `AssertionError: assert(!this.paused)`. `rerun_failed_jobs` on the SAME head
# (`3916de68`) turned it green with no code change: same commit, same gate,
# opposite conclusion. That control is what distinguishes a transient read from a
# diff-caused failure, and it is why this file exists rather than a re-run.
#
# The cost is not one re-run. `README Export Check` is a REQUIRED context
# (`scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs`), and since objectui#6160 the `merge_group`
# subscription floor derives from that same list. `readme-exports.yml`'s own
# trigger block states the consequence, and `changeset-presence.yml`, `ci.yml` and
# `control-bytes.yml` each state it independently:
#
#   "A required check that does not report on a queue build stalls the queue
#    until the ruleset's 60-minute timeout fails it."
#
# ## Why the toolchain fetch is made EXPLICIT here, not just retried
#
# Before this file, nothing in the tree decided WHERE the download happened; it
# happened wherever pnpm was first invoked, and that differs per workflow:
#
#   - ten sites run `pnpm --version` right after `corepack enable`, so the fetch
#     lands in a step named "Verify pnpm version";
#   - seven sites go straight to `actions/setup-node` with `cache: 'pnpm'`, whose
#     store probe shells out to pnpm -- so the fetch lands INSIDE a third-party
#     action's step, which is where it is hardest to recognise;
#   - one site (`docs-route-eager-closure.yml`) has no pnpm cache and no install,
#     so the fetch lands in the gate's own step and reads as the gate failing.
#
# A retry bolted onto `corepack enable` alone would therefore have protected
# nothing in seven of the eighteen sites, because `corepack enable` only writes
# shims -- it is the first pnpm INVOCATION that downloads. So this script does
# both halves in one place: enable the shims, then materialise the pinned binary
# itself, bounded and retried, under a step name that says what it is.
#
# ⭐ That naming is load-bearing beyond tidiness. objectui#8099's triage recorded
# a second cost sitting behind the first: an agent seeing this red has to prove
# the failure is not theirs, and for a markdown-only diff that means fetching the
# job log -- which for container seats is behind an egress-denied host. A red step
# literally named "download the pinned pnpm" is answerable from the checks list
# alone. That second cost is NOT fixed here; it is made unnecessary for this one
# failure class.
#
# ## ⛔ What this does NOT cover, stated so it is not mistaken for covered
#
#   - It does not remove the dependency on `registry.npmjs.org`. Every cold job
#     still reads the registry once. A SUSTAINED registry outage still reds every
#     workflow here; only a cached-tarball approach would survive that, and this
#     is deliberately not that (see the four-axis note on objectui#8099's PR).
#   - It does not make the failure impossible, only bounded-retryable. A blip that
#     outlasts the whole retry budget still fails the job -- loudly, and by then
#     under a step name that says which half of the world broke.
#   - It says nothing about workflows that do not run pnpm. Two files in
#     `.github/workflows/` MENTION `corepack enable` in comments only
#     (`changelog.yml`, `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`), and one of those comments
#     records the objectui#6392 ruling that removed the step there because nothing
#     in that job calls pnpm. ⛔ Neither is a site for this script, and
#     `scripts/__tests__/ci-setup-pnpm-wiring.test.ts` holds that line.
#
# ## Tunables
#
# `CI_SETUP_PNPM_ATTEMPTS` (default 4) and `CI_SETUP_PNPM_BACKOFF_SECONDS`
# (default 5, multiplied by the attempt number) exist so the self-test can run in
# milliseconds. Workflows pass neither -- a worst case of 5+10+15 = 30 seconds of
# sleep is the whole budget, against a 60-minute queue stall.
#
# ## bash 3.2
#
# `scripts/**` is inside `check-bash32-floor.mjs`'s population, so this file is
# held to the bash-3.2 floor (objectui#7692) like every other shell file here.
