 * Exit: 0 = a reading was taken and the change is clean; 1 = FINDINGS;
 *       2 = the reading COULD NOT BE TAKEN (missing base, unparseable lockfile).
 *       2 is never a pass: nothing about the change was judged by that run.
 *
 * ## The incident (objectui#8326, corroborated on #7053, #7054, #7058)
 *
 * Dependabot's regenerated lockfile on #7058 changed 46 package identities,
 * downgrading the whole `@objectstack/*` family 17.3.0 -> 17.2.0 and forking
 * zod into 4.4.3 + 4.5.4. That split the workspace across TWO physical
 * `@objectstack/spec` copies (console / core / runner on one, app-shell /
 * components on the other). Nothing dedupes two real paths, so spec was bundled
 * twice: `vendor-objectstack` 4,030,557 -> 8,423,436 raw bytes (2.09x), the
 * `objectstack/spec` marker count 620 -> 1136.
 *
 * ⭐ The failure mode is what earns the gate, not the byte count: `Bundle
 * Analysis` reds on a dependency bump FOR A REASON THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
 * THE DEPENDENCY, and the obvious reading -- "this bump bloats the bundle" --
 * is wrong. Two seats each spent a full diagnosis reaching the same answer
 * independently. This gate exists to say that in one line.
 *
 * ⛔ It reports. It does not pin, dedupe, or re-resolve anything: the remedy for
 * a finding is a decision (re-lock from a clean base, pin, accept), and the
 * 2026-09-08 triage ruling on #8326 kept that decision out of the gate.
 *
 * ## The two causes it must catch, and why one rule is not enough
 *
 *   cause 1  an `@objectstack/*` identity moves BACKWARD   (objectui#8326)
 *   cause 2  a dependency gains a physical COPY            (objectui#8333)
 *
 * ⭐ objectui#8333 is the measured proof that cause 1 alone is blind. Floating
 * `better-auth` from 1.7.2 to 1.7.3 -- re-measured on `da5e4f69e`, 2026-09-08 --
 * moves NO `@objectstack/*` identity at all: the delta is the better-auth
 * family, `@mongodb-js/saslprep` 1.5.0->1.5.2, `seroval`(-plugins) 1.6.4->1.6.7,
 * every one of them FORWARD, plus one ADDED `zod@4.5.4`. Rule 1 is green on it.
 *
 * ⭐ And rule 2 is not "a single-copy dependency forks", which is the wording
 * both cards use. Measured on `da5e4f69e`: zod is ALREADY two copies on `main`
 * (`zod@3.25.76` + `zod@4.4.3`), so a rule keyed on "was 1, is now 2" is green
 * on #8333 too. The gate therefore compares COUNTS: head > base is a finding,
 * whatever the base count was.
 *
 * ## Why the unit of rule 2 is the SNAPSHOT key, not the version
 *
 * ⭐ Also measured on that re-resolve: `@objectstack/spec` stays at ONE version
 * (17.3.0) and still ends up as TWO physical directories --
 *
 *   base   '@objectstack/spec@17.3.0(ai@7.0.65(zod@4.4.3))'
 *   head   '@objectstack/spec@17.3.0(ai@7.0.65(zod@4.4.3))'
 *          '@objectstack/spec@17.3.0(ai@7.0.65(zod@4.5.4))'
 *
 * -- because pnpm gives each peer resolution its own directory under `.pnpm`.
 * That is #8326's exact bundling mechanism (two real paths, nothing dedupes
 * them) arriving with no version change anywhere. A gate counting VERSIONS
 * reports one spec and passes; a gate counting snapshot keys reports two.
 *
 * ## Boundary: what this does NOT own
 *
 * ⛔ The absolute invariant "the lockfile resolves exactly one
 * `@objectstack/spec` VERSION" is already owned, and is deliberately not
 * restated here -- `scripts/__tests__/ci-cd-pipeline-doc.test.ts`
 * (`ci-cd-pipeline.md — live-e2e backend pin (#7689)`) asserts it as the
 * precondition of comparing `OBJECTSTACK_VERSION` in `e2e/live/ci/backend.env`
 * against the lockfile. Two definitions of one rule are free to drift, so this
 * gate asks a DIFFERENT question: not "is the tree in the right state" but "did
 * THIS CHANGE make it worse". That guard is absolute, single-package,
 * version-level, and on the unit lane; this one is a delta, over every package,
 * at snapshot-key level, and reads two lockfiles.
 *
 * Consequences of that boundary, stated so nobody reads a green as more:
 *
 *   - A lockfile that is ALREADY duplicated stays green here as long as the
 *     change does not make it worse. This is a ratchet, not an audit.
 *   - A backward move outside `@objectstack/*` is not judged. Third-party
 *     downgrades are legitimate (a revert, a yanked release, a security pin).
 *     `@objectstack/*` is scoped in because every workspace range on it is a
 *     floating `^17.x` against a registry whose latest is 17.3.0 -- so a
 *     backward move there cannot be the result of any fresh resolution, which
 *     is #8326's impossibility argument.
 *   - It says nothing about bytes. `Bundle Analysis` measures those; this names
 *     the cause so that reading is not attributed to the dependency.
 *
 * ## Anti-vacuity
 *
 * Both lockfiles must parse to a non-empty snapshot set, and the base and head
 * must not be byte-identical-with-zero-identities. A lockfile format change
 * therefore exits 2 (cannot read) instead of green-over-an-empty-set.
