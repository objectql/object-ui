/**
 * check-sdui-registration-pins -- the registrations a `sideEffects` array
 * PROMISES to keep must still be in the built console.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-sdui-registration-pins.mjs          # the verdict
 *   node scripts/check-sdui-registration-pins.mjs --list   # the derived key set
 *
 * Run it after `pnpm --filter @object-ui/console build`; it weighs
 * `apps/console/dist/assets/*.js`.
 *
 * ## Why a second gate, on the ARTIFACT (objectui#6683)
 *
 * `scripts/check-side-effects-array.mjs` is a static gate: it proves the array
 * agrees with the module bodies. It cannot prove the one thing the hazard turns
 * on -- that a real bundler, reading that array, still emits the registrations.
 * That question has a wrong answer that is invisible from inside the source:
 * `"sideEffects": false` on `@object-ui/app-shell` is statically coherent and
 * DROPS three live SDUI widget registrations. Measured in objectui#6535 /
 * PR #6682: `mcp:connect-agent`, `cloud:onboarding-next` and
 * `cloud:ai-model-status` all fall to **0 chunks**, on a green build, with no
 * warning anywhere -- the barrel reaches them through bare side-effect imports,
 * and `false` licenses the bundler to skip exactly those.
 *
 * The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 names those three as the controls this
 * work must pin present at >= 1 chunk each. This file is that pin, and it is
 * wider than the three on purpose (see below).
 *
 * ## The key set is DERIVED from the array, not listed here
 *
 * The ruling requires the enumeration to be re-derived mechanically rather than
 * copied. So the population is: every module the `sideEffects` array names, read
 * with `scripts/component-registrations.mjs` -- this tree's ONE answer to "which
 * component keys does this source register?". Change the array and the pinned
 * key set changes with it; there is no second list to keep honest.
 *
 * `RULED_CONTROLS` below is not that list. It is an ANTI-VACUITY FLOOR: three
 * keys the ruling names, asserted to be IN the derived set, so a derivation that
 * quietly stopped seeing registrations cannot report "0 keys, all present".
 * A floor is checked against the derivation; a list would replace it.
 *
 * ## Every zero here is loud, in both directions
 *
 *   - a pinned key in 0 chunks   -> the array dropped a registration (exit 1)
 *   - no dist to read            -> exit 2. A gate that reports success over a
 *                                   tree it never measured is the failure mode
 *                                   of every budget gate in this repo.
 *   - 0 keys derived             -> exit 2, for the same reason: "all present"
 *                                   over an empty set is green for nothing.
 *   - the matcher cannot MISS    -> exit 2. A sentinel key that must be absent
 *                                   is searched for on every run, because a
 *                                   matcher that matches everything reports
 *                                   every key present and can never fail.

/**
 * `pkg.declared`, ordered so a module's SOURCE spelling is read before its
 * PUBLISHED spelling.
 *
 * ## Why the order is fixed here rather than left to the array (objectui#6893)
 *
 * A `sideEffects` array names every registering module TWICE -- once as
 * `src/x.tsx`, once as `dist/x.js` (see `check-side-effects-array.mjs`: both
 * spellings are required, because consumers resolve the published one and
 * in-repo bundler aliases resolve the source one). {@link derivePinnedKeys}
 * attributes each key to the FIRST module it read the key from, so without an
 * order of its own the attribution was decided by two things that have nothing
 * to say about it: the literal order of the entries in `package.json`, and
 * whether `dist/` happens to be on disk. `packages/app-shell/dist` is
 * gitignored, so the SAME COMMIT attributed `mcp:connect-agent` to
 * `.../src/console/connect/ConnectAgentWidget.tsx` on an unbuilt checkout and to
 * `.../dist/console/connect/ConnectAgentWidget.js` on a built one.
 *
 * The published spelling is still READ -- `keys` is a union deduplicated by key,
 * so reordering cannot change the derived population, only which spelling is
 * reported for it. Source-first is the right end of that choice because the
 * attribution is a diagnostic pointing an author at the module to go fix, and
 * `dist/` is a build artifact nobody edits.
 *
 * `srcRoot` comes from the package's own derived spelling map rather than from a
 * hardcoded `dist` test, so there is no second answer here to "which prefix is
 * the source one" that could rot away from the one `check-side-effects-array`
 * derives and round-trip-checks.
 *
 * @param {{name: string, dir: string, manifest: object, declared: string[]}} pkg
 * @param {string} [root]
 * @returns {string[]}
