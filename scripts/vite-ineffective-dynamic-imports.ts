/**
 * Pins rolldown's `INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT` warnings to a checked ledger.
 *
 * ## The warning, and what it is telling the truth about
 *
 * Rolldown emits `INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT` when a module reached by an
 * `import()` is ALSO reached by a static `import` somewhere in the graph. The
 * module is in the eager closure regardless, so the `import()` cannot move it
 * into another chunk — the laziness is decoration:
 *
 * ```
 * [INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT] packages/fields/src/widgets/GridField.tsx is
 * dynamically imported by packages/fields/src/index.tsx but also statically
 * imported by packages/fields/src/index.tsx, dynamic import will not move
 * module into another chunk.
 * ```
 *
 * Every console `vite build` emits 43 of these, all from `packages/fields`
 * (objectui#5325). They are TRUE, and that is the problem this file solves: 43
 * true warnings that nobody can act on, scrolling past every build, is how a
 * build log stops being read at all — and the next warning, the one that IS
 * new, scrolls past with them.
 *
 * ## Why the graph is not being fixed instead
 *
 * Measured twice, on `77f846a8b` and again while writing this file. Two
 * mechanisms produce the 43, and neither is cheap to remove:
 *
 *  - **27** name `packages/fields/src/FieldEditWidget.tsx` as a second static
 *    importer. That is the grid's inline cell editor, which imports its widgets
 *    synchronously because a cell edits in place. Surgery on the barrel does
 *    not touch these at all.
 *  - **16** are defeated only by `packages/fields/src/index.tsx`'s own
 *    `export * from './widgets/*.js'` lines. Removing those is a BREAKING
 *    change to `@object-ui/fields`: it failed the console build with 16
 *    `MISSING_EXPORT` errors, and 14 widget classes are imported by name from
 *    the package across `plugin-detail`, `plugin-form`, `app-shell` and
 *    `apps/console`, never mind published consumers outside this repo.
 *
 * And removing them would buy nothing, because the laziness is defeated a
 * SECOND time one level up, by chunking. `apps/console/vite.config.ts` declares
 * an `advancedChunks` group `ui-components` whose test matches
 * `packages/(components|fields)`; group assignment overrides a module's
 * async-only reachability, so every `packages/fields` module lands in one chunk
 * — and that chunk is eager, because `packages/components` is reached
 * synchronously from the entry. This is objectui#5266's mechanism, the same one
 * `assertLazyLinterStaysLazy` in the console config exists to catch.
 *
 * The CONTROL that proves the second defeat, re-measured on this branch:
 * `packages/fields/src/widgets/MarkdownContent.tsx` has a working `React.lazy`
 * (from `widgets/richTextDisplay.tsx`), is re-exported by nothing, and has no
 * static importer anywhere in production code — so it emits NO warning and is
 * absent from the ledger below. It still lands in the eager
 * `ui-components-*.js`. Counter-probed so `EAGER` is not a stuck answer: the
 * same walk reports `lazy` for `plugin-map`, `plugin-charts` and
 * `plugin-report`. Barrel surgery therefore moves zero bytes; measured
 * directly on `77f846a8b` it moved the eager closure by **+329** bytes and left
 * the chunk count at 58.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-22 (recorded on objectui#5325): take option C —
 * leave the lazy/static import structure as it is, no barrel surgery, no
 * public-surface breakage, and stop the warnings from reading as noise. Option
 * A — stop the `ui-components` group from claiming `packages/fields/**` so a
 * lazy widget can get its own chunk, THEN remove the defeating static edges —
 * is retained as an on-hold measurement, because it is the only order in which
 * the barrel work buys bytes and the group exists to prevent chunk explosion.
 *
 * ## Why this is a ledger and not a filter
 *
 * A one-line `if (code === 'INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT') return false` would
 * satisfy the letter of "stop the noise" and be strictly worse than the noise.
 * Today those warnings are the ONLY thing in the repo that says the laziness
 * does not work; deleting them keeps the defect and destroys its last witness,
 * and a 44th widget joining the list tomorrow would land in total silence.
 *
 * So the warnings are not suppressed, they are PROMOTED. Each one is matched
 * against {@link DEFEATED_LAZY_FIELD_WIDGETS}, and the build then fails on
 * either direction of drift:
 *
 *  - **unpinned** — an ineffective dynamic import this ledger does not know
 *    about. That is a NEW defect. Its original warning is printed in full,
 *    verbatim from rolldown, and the build stops.
 *  - **missing** — a pinned entry that did not fire. Either someone fixed it
 *    (record the win: delete the line, say so in the PR) or the ledger has gone
 *    blind.
 *
 * The `missing` half is the counter-probe, and it is the reason this check
 * cannot quietly become decorative. The dangerous reading here is ZERO, not
 * many: a console build that dies before chunk assignment emits no warnings at
 * all, and objectui#5325 recorded exactly that trap — a build killed by 16
 * `MISSING_EXPORT` errors reported `0` `INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT` warnings,
 * which reads identically to "fixed" if nothing demands a positive sighting.
 * With `missing` checked, a blind build fails with 43 named absences instead.
 *
 * ## Why the counter-probe stands down when the build has already failed
 *
 * `closeBundle` runs even when the build has ALREADY errored, and an error
 * thrown from it REPLACES the build's own error in `vite build`'s output — not
 * appended, not printed above it, gone. So every console build that died before
 * the warnings could be emitted reported 43 named absences instead of its own
 * cause, and the `did NOT fire` wording sends the reader straight at
 * {@link DEFEATED_LAZY_FIELD_WIDGETS}, which is the one edit that would break
 * the ledger for real (objectui#6093).
 *
 * The condition to detect is the one this file's own message already names —
 * "this build never got far enough to emit them". `closeBundle` cannot tell
 * that from "zero because they were all fixed" on its own, so the plugin
 * collects the missing input from the hooks that ARE told, and the probe stands
 * down when any of them fired. Measured on vite 8.2.1 + rolldown 1.2.3, because
 * the hooks do NOT all report a failure and the gaps decide the design:
 *
 * | build dies in    | `buildEnd(error)` | `renderError` | our `writeBundle` |
 * |------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
 * | `transform`      | ERROR             | not called    | not called        |
 * | `renderChunk`    | no argument       | called        | not called        |
 * | `generateBundle` | no argument       | not called    | not called        |
 * | `writeBundle`    | no argument       | not called    | not called        |
 * | nothing (green)  | no argument       | not called    | CALLED            |
 *
 * `buildEnd`/`renderError` alone therefore cover only the top two rows — and
 * the failure objectui#6093 was measured on is the bottom one, a `writeBundle`
 * error from `emit-eager-closure-report`. The third signal closes it: this
 * plugin's own `writeBundle` runs only when nothing before it threw, so
 * "`closeBundle` reached, `writeBundle` never ran" IS "this build did not
 * finish". It is declared `order: 'post'` so the marker does not depend on
 * where this plugin sits in the array — a plugin ordered AFTER it that throws
 * in `writeBundle` still leaves the marker unset (measured; with default order
 * it does not).
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It does not weaken the check on a
 * build that SUCCEEDS: output written and zero sightings still fails, with the
 * same message, which is the case the probe was written for and the control
 * that proves this change turned nothing off. And it does not swallow the
 * finding silently — a stand-down prints one line saying the ledger was not
 * checked and why, because a gate that produces no output at all on a failed
 * build is indistinguishable from a gate that passed.
 *
 * `build.write === false` is the one build that legitimately reaches
 * `closeBundle` with no `writeBundle` (measured), so the marker is only read as
 * failure evidence when this build was going to write at all. That direction is
 * chosen on purpose: an unwritten build there keeps the probe ARMED rather than
 * standing it down, since a silent probe is the failure mode with no witness.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * The ledger holds the DEFEATED MODULES — the `id` of each warning — and
 * nothing else. The static importers (`ids`) are read and summarised on every
 * build, but not pinned: they churn with ordinary refactors inside
 * `packages/fields`, and a gate that fires on an unrelated PR with a message
 * about somebody else's card is how a gate gets switched off. Byte regressions
 * are already covered, one layer up, by `emitEagerClosureReport` and
 * `scripts/check-eager-closure-budget.mjs`.
