 * check-entry-guard -- every `scripts/**` entry guard goes through ONE predicate.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-entry-guard.mjs              # scan the tree
 *   node scripts/check-entry-guard.mjs --list       # every exporting file, and what runs on import
 *   node scripts/check-entry-guard.mjs --self-test  # verify the checker itself
 *
 * Ported from objectstack's gate of the same name (objectstack#10784 and the
 * cards above it), NOT copied: objectstack swept its tree BEFORE landing the
 * gate, so its spelling rule admits no exceptions at all. This repository was
 * swept the other way round -- gate first, then the sweep -- so the port landed
 * carrying a baseline of 29 owed files that objectstack has no need for. That
 * baseline is now EMPTY: objectui#6092's second half converted all 29 and
 * deleted every line. The design question the shape answers -- how a baseline
 * is kept from becoming an allowlist -- is what got it to empty, and is still
 * what keeps a new line from being added. See "The baseline" below.
 *
 * Two rules live here. The first is about the SPELLING of a guard that exists;
 * the second, further down, is about a guard that is MISSING from a file that
 * exports. They are separate because the second one is meaningless for the
 * files here that export nothing.
 *
 * ## What this gate is for
 *
 * A CLI script has to answer "did node run me, or did something import me?"
 * before it does anything. Hand-typed answers to that question HAD drifted
 * into NINE distinct spellings across 28 `.mjs` files in `scripts/` here --
 * measured on `133e2ea1e`, not estimated -- and every one of them was wrong in
 * the same way. All 29 sites (those 28 plus `shadcn-sync.js`) now go through
 * the predicate; what this gate is for is the TENTH spelling, which nothing
 * else in CI can see. The dominant failure:
 *
 *   node resolves symlinks for the module graph but leaves `process.argv[1]`
 *   as the caller typed it
 *
 * so a script reached through a symlink compares two different paths, answers
 * `false`, and does nothing -- **exit 0, no output**. The CI wrappers spawn
 * these tools and hold `result.status` only, so an inert child is a green gate.
 *
 * That was measured in THIS tree, on a real blocking gate (objectui#6078),
 * against the spelling `check-skills-paths.mjs` carried before the sweep:
 *
 *   node scripts/check-skills-paths.mjs              direct  : exit=1, 696 bytes
 *   node /…/link/check-skills-paths.mjs  (symlink)   symlink : exit=0, 0 bytes
 *
 * Same tree, same defect, same gate. A second spelling went inert with no
 * symlink at all: `check-node-esm-load.mjs` wrote
 * ``import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}` ``, which percent-encodes
 * apart from `argv[1]` in any directory whose name needs encoding (measured in
 * a directory named `a#b c`). Both files now use the predicate; the two
 * measurements are kept because they are why the rule exists, not a to-do.
 *
 * `scripts/invoked-as.mjs` is the only place allowed to read `process.argv[1]`;
 * everywhere else spells the guard
 *
 *   if (isEntrypoint(import.meta.url)) { ... }
 *
 * which has no comparison in it to get wrong.
 *
 * ## Why the gate landed BEFORE the sweep
 *
 * The sweep on its own is worth little: nothing would stop a TENTH spelling
 * from being typed the next time someone adds a script, and the next one would
 * be just as invisible. That is not hypothetical here -- objectui#6092 measured
 * the worklist growing while the card sat open: `check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`
 * added a guard between `a1c41c516` and `7c96c9420`. A sweep with no gate under
 * it can be silently undone by the next pull request. So the gate landed first
 * and named its own worklist, and the conversion of those 29 call sites landed
 * against it -- each conversion had to lower or delete its own baseline line or
 * this gate failed STALE and named the file, which is what made the sweep
 * self-checking rather than a claim.
 *
 * ## The baseline, and why it is not an allowlist
 *
 * ⛔ SHRINK-ONLY, and shaped so the difference is mechanical rather than a
 * promise. `KNOWN_HAND_TYPED_GUARDS` maps a file to the NUMBER of masked
 * `process.argv[1]` occurrences it carried when this gate landed. It is EMPTY
 * now; the shape is what emptied it, in three consequences:
 *
 *   • a file NOT in the map that carries a guard fails -- with the map empty
 *     that is every file, so this is the whole live rule today and a 30th
 *     spelling cannot land;
 *   • a file IN the map that carries MORE than its number failed -- a second
 *     guard could not be smuggled into an already-owed file, which a
 *     path-only baseline would have accepted silently;
 *   • a file that carried FEWER failed as STALE and named itself, with the
 *     remedy being to lower or delete the line. There was no supported route
 *     that raised a number, and there is none that adds one back.
 *
 * The last two are unreachable while the map is empty, and they stay in
 * `reconcileGuards` (and pinned by the self-test) precisely because that is the
 * state a re-added line would have to pass through: a baseline that only ever
 * shrank cannot be re-opened as an allowlist.
 *
 * Every entry had the same one-line remedy -- `isEntrypoint(import.meta.url)`
 * -- so no entry recorded a judgement anyone had to re-make. That is the
 * property that made the debt list safe, and it is the only reason one was here.
 *
 * ONE of the 29 was different in kind: `scripts/shadcn-sync.js` hand-typed the
 * CORRECT two-leg shape (`realpathSync(resolved) === __filename`), so this gate
 * never reported it as a defect. It was in the map because the rule is "one
 * predicate", not "one predicate or a second correct implementation" -- its
 * conversion was a simplification, not a fix, and that distinction is now
 * recorded at the call site in `shadcn-sync.js` rather than here.
 *
 * ## Why a spelling gate rather than a behavioural sweep
 *
 * The tempting alternative is to RUN every `scripts/**` entry point and assert
 * it produced something. That was rejected upstream on measurement, and the
 * same reasoning holds here:
 *
 *   • many of these scripts have real side effects (`shadcn-sync`,
 *     `sync-quick-reference-release`, `regenerate-known-schema-types`), so a
 *     gate that spawns all of them is a gate nobody can run locally;
 *   • "produced output" is not a decidable property of an arbitrary tool -- a
 *     quiet-on-success script is legitimate, so the assertion would have to be
 *     per-script, which is the same per-file hand-wiring this gate replaces.
 *
 * The behavioural evidence lives once, at the predicate: `invoked-as.mjs`'s
 * self-test drives a real probe through a real symlink, a differently-named
 * symlink, a path needing percent-encoding, and both import directions.
 *
 * ## What it reads
 *
 * Comments AND string/template/regex literals are masked before the scan
 * (`js-comment-mask.mjs`), because a `process.argv[1]` inside a string payload
 * for a spawned child is not an entry guard, and neither is one inside a
 * docblock. That masking is load-bearing, not defensive: after the sweep the
 * only `scripts/` files that still contain the string at all are this gate
 * (skipped -- it quotes the idioms it bans), `invoked-as.mjs` (the one module
 * allowed to read it), and `js-comment-mask.mjs`, whose own corpus carries 8
 * occurrences in literals. Unmasked, that last file would read as a 30th
 * hand-typed guard, and an allowlist to excuse it would be a hole the next such
 * file falls through silently.
 *
 * ## What was deliberately NOT ported
 *
 * objectstack's copy carries a `ROOT_DIR_WATCH_HINTS` declaration read by its
 * `scripts/pm/dispatch-gates.mjs`. There is no such tool in this repository, so
 * the declaration would be a literal nothing reads, and its self-test cases
 * would assert a contract with an absent consumer. It is left out rather than
 * carried as decoration -- a ported claim about a file that does not exist here
 * is the exact defect objectui#6078 recorded against `invoked-as.mjs`'s header.

/**
 * ## The second finding kind: an EXPORTING file whose top level runs on import

 * wrong for a file that DOES export, because `import { helper } from

 * own code after the `import` never runs and its caller reads success. That is

 * arriving through a different door.
 *
 * ## What the rule asserts, and why it needs no exception list
 *
 * A `scripts/**` file that exports a binding must have every top-level statement
 * that RUNS something inside the guard. Declarations are not statements that run
 * — `const HERE = resolve(...)` is how every file in here computes its own
 * paths, and flagging those would flag the whole tree. A file that exports
 * nothing is never reached, and neither is a module of declarations only, so
 * pure library modules need no entry anywhere — which is the point of shaping
 * it this way. An exception list would have been judgements nobody re-checks,
 * i.e. the same drift one level up.

 * anyone re-makes. A file this rule newly reaches is a failure with one remedy,
 * never a line in here. An entry whose file has since been fixed fails as STALE
 * and names itself, which is what stops this from rotting into an allowlist.
 *
 * ONE entry, and that is the point: this rule recognises a hand-typed guard AS
 * a guard (see `guardAliases`), so the 29 badly-spelled files are rule 1's
 * business and do not appear here. `check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs` builds
 * two lookup maps in top-level `for` loops at :243 and :245, outside any guard,
 * and really does run them inside an importer.
 *
 * ⚠️ Its remedy is NOT "move the loops behind the guard": those maps are read by
 * the exported `liveSpellingFor` / `describeName`, which importers really call
 * (`scripts/__tests__/check-lucide-icon-record-names.test.ts`), so guarding them
 * turns a working import into a broken one. Measured on this branch, not
 * reasoned: with the loops moved behind the guard that suite fails. objectui#6092
 * ruled the restructuring out of scope rather than trade an import for a
 * baseline; the entry stays, and its remedy is a judgement someone still has to
 * make -- which is exactly what the rest of this comment says a debt line must
 * not be. It is the one line here that owes a card, not a one-liner.
