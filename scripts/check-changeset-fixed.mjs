/**
 * Validates how `.changeset/config.json` classifies every workspace package for
 * release. Three rules, all decided from the config file plus the manifests:
 *
 *   1. every workspace package under `packages/` and `apps/` is either in the
 *      `fixed` group or matched by `ignore`;
 *   2. `privatePackages` is declared explicitly;
 *   3. no PRIVATE package sits in the `fixed` group while
 *      `privatePackages.version` is false.
 *
 * Rule 1 is the original one and is version-agnostic. Rules 2 and 3 exist
 * because `@changesets/cli@3` changed what an ABSENT `privatePackages` means,
 * and this repo has a private package inside the `fixed` group — `object-ui`
 * (`packages/vscode-extension`), private because it ships to the VS Code
 * marketplace rather than npm, but versioned in lockstep with the 39
 * publishable packages so its version keeps matching the runtime it embeds.
 *
 * What changed, measured against `@changesets/config@4.0.0` rather than
 * recalled: an omitted `privatePackages` used to default to
 * `{ version: true, tag: false }` and now defaults to
 * `{ version: false, tag: false }`, and `version: false` does not merely skip
 * the version bump — it feeds `allowPrivatePackages: false` into the release
 * assembler, i.e. the package is treated as IGNORED. A changeset that names one
 * ignored and one non-ignored package is then a "mixed changeset", which
 * `assembleReleasePlan` refuses outright:
 *
 *     Error: Found mixed changeset no-console-lint-rule
 *     Found ignored packages: object-ui
 *     Found not ignored packages: @object-ui/app-shell @object-ui/fields …
 *     Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are
 *     not allowed
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical: `.changeset/no-console-lint-rule.md` in the stock
 * pending at the time of the v3 migration named exactly that combination, so
 * bumping the CLI without declaring the key exited 1 on `changeset status` AND
 * on `changeset version` — the release lane stops, and nothing in PR CI would
 * have said so, because no PR workflow runs either command (the only invocation
 * is inside `.github/workflows/changeset-release.yml`, on push to `main`).
 *
 * Hence rule 2: silence about `privatePackages` is no longer a safe default,
 * because its meaning inverted. And hence rule 3: `fixed` membership and
 * `version: false` are a contradiction — one says "version this in lockstep",
 * the other says "this is ignored" — and changesets does not diagnose the
 * contradiction at config-read time, only later as the mixed-changeset error,
 * from whichever changeset happens to trip it.
 *
 * Runs on a bare checkout with no `pnpm install` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
 * job `changeset-check`, is a checkout plus one `node` call), so this file may
 * not import `@changesets/*` or any other dependency. Keep it that way.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-changeset-fixed.mjs
 * Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = a package is misclassified or the config is under-declared
