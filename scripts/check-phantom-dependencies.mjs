/**
 * Every bare specifier a released package imports must be DECLARED by that
 * package — not merely resolvable from it.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-phantom-dependencies.mjs   (also `pnpm check:phantom-deps`)
 * Exit: 0 = every in-scope import is declared, 1 = at least one is a phantom
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (objectui#4394)
 *
 * `@object-ui/core` is React-free by construction and by declaration: no `.tsx`
 * file, no `from 'react'`, no `react` in its `dependencies`, and an empty
 * `peerDependencies`. AGENTS.md section 3 pins it in words too — "No UI-lib deps.
 * Logic only." And yet:
 *
 *     $ node -e "console.log(require.resolve('react', { paths: ['packages/core/src'] }))"
 *     …/node_modules/.pnpm/react@19.2.8/node_modules/react/index.js
 *
 * The cause is benign and permanent: the ROOT `package.json` carries
 * `devDependencies.react` (the DOM vitest projects need it), so a
 * `node_modules/react` symlink exists at the workspace root, and Node's — and
 * TypeScript's — upward directory walk reaches it from ANY package directory.
 * pnpm's isolated `node_modules` prevents phantom dependencies BETWEEN workspace
 * packages; it does not defend a package against the root's own dev
 * dependencies.
 *
 * So a dependency-direction check performed BY RESOLUTION returns the wrong
 * answer, and returns it confidently. objectui#4394 recorded the trap after
 * objectui#4389's brief asked its implementer to "measure the actual import
 * graph", where the resolution probe is the obvious way to do that. A `react`
 * import added to `packages/core` would typecheck, build and pass every local
 * suite, then break the published `@object-ui/core` for the first consumer who
 * does not already have React installed — discovered at install time, by
 * somebody else.
 *
 * The authoritative question is not "does it resolve here" but "does the package
 * that PUBLISHES this file declare it". That is what this gate asks, and it is a
 * question root hoisting cannot answer for anyone.
 *
 * ## What the first full run found
 *
 * Not zero. `packages/plugin-detail/src/renderers/PermissionFacetLink.tsx` and
 * `record-reference-rail.tsx` import `react-router-dom`, which
 * `@object-ui/plugin-detail` declares in no field at all — while its three
 * siblings that use the same hooks (`app-shell`, `layout`, `plugin-designer`)
 * all declare it as a peer of `^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0`. That is not a latent risk in
 * that package: its `vite.config.ts` externalises every bare specifier
 * (`external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)`), so the
 * published `dist/index.js` carries a bare `react-router-dom` import that the
 * package's manifest never mentions. The declaration was added in the same pull
 * request as this gate, which is why the gate lands ENFORCING with no baseline
 * ledger: the surface it had to clear was two distinct (package, specifier)
 * pairs across seven call sites, and one of them was a real defect.
 *
 * ## Two tiers, because two different things ship
 *
 * A phantom dependency hurts when it reaches a CONSUMER. Which files can do that
 * is not uniform, so the rule is not either:
 *
 *   - RUNTIME files — everything under `src/` that is not test tooling. These
 *     compile or bundle into the published artifact, and (for the library
 *     packages, whose rollup config externalises every bare specifier) their
 *     imports stay bare in `dist`. Judged against the package's own
 *     `dependencies` / `peerDependencies` / `optionalDependencies`. A
 *     `devDependencies` entry is NOT an answer here: it is not installed for a
 *     consumer, which is the whole failure.
 *   - TOOLING files — `__tests__/`, `__mocks__/`, `__benchmarks__/`, and
 *     `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` / `*.bench.*` / `*.stories.*`. No consumer ever
 *     RESOLVES one: they are not entry points and nothing in a published
 *     artifact imports them. Judged against the package's own four dependency
 *     fields OR the WORKSPACE ROOT's `devDependencies`.
 *
 *     "Not resolved" is the load-bearing claim, and it is deliberately weaker
 *     than "not present in the tarball" — which would be false. objectui#4006
 *     measured 73 `*.test.d.ts` files landing in the published `dist/` of
 *     `@object-ui/fields` and `@object-ui/plugin-editor`, and three packages
 *     (`fields`, `types`, `data-objectstack`) listed `src` in `files`, so their
 *     tarballs carried the test SOURCES too. Two of the three no longer do:
 *     objectui#4847 dropped `src` from `data-objectstack`'s `files` (43 source
 *     files, 38 of them tests, left that tarball) and objectui#4856 dropped it
 *     from `fields`' (173 source files, 97 of them tests). Only `types` still
 *     lists it, and there the entry is load-bearing rather than leftover,
 *     because it builds with a bare `tsc` under the root's `declarationMap` /
 *     `sourceMap` and no `inlineSources`, so its shipped `dist/*.d.ts.map` name
 *     `../src/*.ts` with no embedded content — dropping `src` there would leave
 *     published maps pointing at files the tarball no longer carries. `fields`
 *     was measurably NOT that shape, which is why the two were split rather than
 *     fixed together: its declarations come from `vite-plugin-dts`, and a clean
 *     rebuild emits zero `.map` files and zero `sourceMappingURL` comments, so
 *     nothing in its `dist` referred back to `src` at all. That is a real defect
 *     where it is one, and it is already filed; it is not this gate's, because
 *     nothing resolves those files and so no install of them can fail. Stated
 *     here rather than glossed, because "the build excludes tests" is the
 *     plausible-sounding version of this paragraph and it is not what the
 *     repository measures.
 *
 * The root allowance is a decision, not an oversight, and it is worth stating
 * why it is honest rather than convenient. This repository installs its test
 * toolchain once, at the root: measured over `main`, 1873 tooling imports in
 * released packages resolve to something the package itself does not declare,
 * and 74 of the 76 distinct (package, specifier) pairs are exactly four names —
 * `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`,
 * `@testing-library/user-event`. Demanding thirty packages re-declare those
 * would be a large mechanical churn that protects no consumer, because none of
 * those files is published. What the allowance still catches is the real thing:
 * a tooling import of a package declared NOWHERE — not by the package, not by
 * the root — which is a module nothing in this repository installs on purpose.
 * The count of imports that lean on the allowance is printed on every run, so
 * the size of the concession stays visible rather than being absorbed.
 *
 * What this tier split deliberately does NOT do is police LAYERING. "May
 * `@object-ui/core` import React at all" is a different property with a
 * different home (AGENTS.md section 3, and objectui#4389); a core test file that
 * imported React would satisfy this gate and still be wrong. This gate answers
 * one question — is what you import declared where a consumer can see it — and
 * answering a second one badly is worse than not answering it.
 *
 * ## The explicit gradings
 *
 * Each of these is a judgement the gate had to make. They are written down
 * rather than buried, because a silent grading is indistinguishable from a bug:
 *
 *   - **Type-only imports are STRICT.** `import type { X } from 'pkg'` is judged
 *     exactly like a value import. Three reasons, in order of weight. The
 *     declaration coupling is real and it survives erasure: the emitted `.d.ts`
 *     keeps the reference, so a consumer type-checking against this package
 *     needs `pkg`'s types installed, and an undeclared one leaves them with
 *     `TS2307` in a file they did not write. It is also one edit from becoming a
 *     value import, and nothing would report the promotion. And a carve-out here
 *     is the tolerant-consumer shape AGENTS.md #0.1 rejects on principle. The
 *     measurement says this costs nothing today: of the seven runtime-file
 *     violations on `main`, zero were type-only, so strictness is free at the
 *     moment it lands — which is exactly when to choose it.
 *   - **Node builtins need `@types/node`.** `node:fs` and bare `fs` are provided
 *     by the runtime, never installed, so "declared" cannot mean a dependency
 *     entry; what a package CAN declare is that it targets Node at all.
 *     `@types/node` in any of its dependency fields is that declaration —
 *     including `devDependencies`, and that is correct rather than lax: a types
 *     package is never a runtime import, so `dependencies` would be the wrong
 *     field for it. Measured on `main`: every builtin import in a package that
 *     does not declare `@types/node` is in a tooling file (33 pairs, all of
 *     them), and every runtime builtin import — `@object-ui/cli`'s `fs`, `path`,
 *     `url`, `child_process` — is in a package that declares it. So this lands
 *     enforcing at zero cost too.
 *   - **Host-provided modules are declared in `HOST_PROVIDED`,** with the
 *     evidence each one requires. `vscode` is the specimen: it is injected by
 *     the extension host, is not on npm as a runtime package, and declaring it
 *     as a dependency would be the mistake. `packages/vscode-extension` earns
 *     the exemption by declaring `@types/vscode` AND `engines.vscode` — checked
 *     on every run, so the exemption cannot outlive its evidence.
 *   - **A self-reference is allowed when the package declares `exports`.** Node
 *     resolves a package's own name through its own `exports` map, so
 *     `@object-ui/core` importing `@object-ui/core` is legal and installs
 *     nothing. Without `exports` it does not resolve, and that is reported.
 *   - **`@/…` is not a package.** npm's grammar has no empty scope, so a
 *     specifier whose first segment cannot be a package name is a tsconfig path
 *     alias (every package here maps `@/*` to `src/*`). Skipped by GRAMMAR, not
 *     by a name list.
 *
 * ## The one exemption with a manifest, and why it is verified
 *
 * `@object-ui/console` imports ~325 modules across its `src/` that it declares
 * only in `devDependencies`, and that is right: it is an APPLICATION. Its build
 * is a Vite app build with no `build.lib` and no `rollupOptions.external`, so
 * every one of those imports is INLINED into `dist/`, and the published package
 * is that bundle plus a `plugin.js` wrapper. Nothing a consumer installs
 * resolves them. `BUNDLED_APPLICATIONS` records that, and re-derives the two
 * properties it rests on every run — the build script still runs `vite build`,
 * and the config still declares neither of the two keys that would make the
 * imports external again. The day either changes, the exemption fails loudly
 * instead of quietly covering a package that has started shipping bare imports.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated so it is not mistaken for more
 *
 *   - `src/**` of the packages in the `fixed` group of `.changeset/config.json`,
 *     read from that file for the same reason `check-changeset-presence.mjs`
 *     reads it: the release configuration is where "published" is actually
 *     defined, and a hand-written glob would have missed `apps/console` exactly
 *     as it did there.
 *   - Files OUTSIDE `src/` are not read — a package's `vite.config.ts`,
 *     `scripts/`, or a published sidecar such as `apps/console/plugin.ts`. Those
 *     resolve at build time or against a different manifest; widening to them
 *     means grading build tooling by the same rule as shipped code, which is a
 *     different gate.
 *   - The REVERSE direction — a declared dependency nothing imports — is not
 *     checked. It is a real question (dead weight in every consumer's install)
 *     and a different one; a package may legitimately declare something it uses
 *     from a non-`src` path.
 *   - Tooling material that reaches the TARBALL is objectui#4006's, not this
 *     gate's: see the tier note above for the measurement and for why "nothing
 *     resolves it" is the claim that keeps the tooling tier sound.
