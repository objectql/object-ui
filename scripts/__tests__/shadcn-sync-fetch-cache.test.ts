/**
 * objectstack#5803 — the registry cache stored whatever came back.
 *
 * `fetchUrl` never looked at `res.statusCode`, and a non-JSON body was caught
 * and resolved as a raw string, so an egress allowlist answering
 * `403 Host not in allowlist: ui.shadcn.com…` resolved as if it were a
 * component. `fetchRegistry` then wrote it to disk unconditionally with a
 * one-hour TTL, and for the next hour every `pnpm shadcn:check` answered from
 * those 46 poisoned entries without retrying — reported, in the summary line,
 * as "46 cached, 0 fetched".
 *
 * The reproduction that motivated the fix, verbatim:
 *
 *     run 1: ✗ … Registry returned no usable file content   (46 errors)
 *            Registry: 0 cached, 46 fetched
 *     run 2: ✗ … Registry returned no usable file content   (46 errors)
 *            Registry: 46 cached, 0 fetched      <- never retried
 *
 * These tests are OFFLINE by construction: the shadcn registry is not
 * reachable from CI (nor from the sandbox this was written in), which is
 * exactly the condition that produced the bug. Every case below drives a local
 * `http` fixture server — a real socket, real status lines, real chunking —
 * with `http.get` injected in place of `https.get`. The status/parse logic
 * under test is transport-independent, so nothing is stubbed out.

  /**
   * A hung registry request used to have nothing bounding it: `https.get`
   * only ever wired up `error` and `end`, and a black-holed connection fires
   * neither. `--check` runs 46 of these in series, so one hang stalled the
   * whole command until something outside the script (a CI job timeout, a
   * person hitting Ctrl-C) gave up, with no line in the log naming which URL
   * stuck.
   *
   * Two distinct network conditions produce that hang — a dropped SYN (the
   * connection itself never completes) and a peer that completes the TCP
   * handshake and then never writes a byte. Both are covered by the SAME
   * `req.setTimeout` callback in `fetchUrl`, because Node arms that idle
   * timer as soon as a socket is assigned to the request, before the
   * handshake resolves — there is no separate "connecting" branch to test.
   *
   * Both are exercised below with a `get` double that mimics a `ClientRequest`
   * stuck before its response ever arrives — same wiring (`setTimeout(ms, cb)`
   * + `destroy(error)` + the request's own `error` listener) `fetchUrl`
   * actually depends on, deterministic, and independent of real network
   * timing.
   *
   * A REAL socket was used first, and deliberately is not the committed test:
   * a raw `net` server that accepts the connection and never writes back
   * (`http.get` injected as `get`) reproduces the hang correctly outside
   * vitest — confirmed clean and fast (rejects in ~40-50ms against a 40ms
   * `timeoutMs`, twice in a row, matching this file's cache/registry
   * assertions) both as a standalone Node script and inside a `worker_threads`
   * Worker, including while this shared container had a sibling agent's
   * `pnpm --filter @object-ui/console^... build` pegging multiple cores. The
   * SAME code, run through Vitest's `threads` pool under that same load,
   * reliably failed to observe the timeout at all — not slow, genuinely
   * silent for the full 20s `it()` bound, reproducing identically with
   * `-t` isolating the one test and with `--maxWorkers=1`. That is a
   * Vitest-threads-pool-under-contention interaction with the real socket
   * timer, not a defect in `fetchUrl`: this repo's own flaky-test discipline
   * (AGENTS.md, "flaky 测试") is explicit that widening a budget to paper
   * over a race is the wrong fix, and here even a 20s budget did not turn a
   * genuine non-event into a passing one. A real socket cannot honestly be
   * asserted on on this platform without that risk, so the committed
   * coverage stays on the double above (see also `fetchRegistry propagates
   * timeoutMs`, same shape, one level up the call stack) plus the manual
   * verification recorded here and in the PR description.
