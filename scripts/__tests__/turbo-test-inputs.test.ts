/**
 * objectui#4178 — turbo's `test` task has the same out-of-package `inputs` hole
 * that objectui#3514 closed for `type-check`, and it has it worse.
 *
 * Turbo hashes a task from its `inputs`. `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` covers only files
 * inside the package directory, and `globalDependencies` is unset — so any file
 * the task reads from elsewhere in the repo is invisible to the cache key. When
 * such a file changes, turbo does not re-run the task; it REPLAYS the previous
 * verdict. Before this guard, EVERY entry in the `test` task's list was
 * package-relative:
 *
 *     "inputs": ["src/**", "test/**", "tests/**", "vitest.config.*",
 *                "vitest.setup.*", "tsconfig*.json", "package.json",
 *                "$TURBO_DEFAULT$", and two negated markdown globs]
 *
 * (The two negations are spelled out in `turbo.json`, not here: a `!` glob of
 * that shape carries the character pair that ENDS a block comment, and a
 * docblock that terminates early takes the rest of itself down with it —
 * `tsconfig.scripts.json` carries the same warning for the same reason.)
 *
 * `vitest.config.*` and `vitest.setup.*` read as if they covered the Vitest
 * configuration. They do not: they resolve inside the package, while the files
 * that actually decide how a package's tests run live at the repo root. Every
 * package reaches them. Since objectui#3240 it reaches them BY NAME: every
 * package's `test` script is `vitest run --root ../.. packages/<pkg>/`, so the
 * resolution starts at the repo root and lands on `vitest.config.mts` directly.
 * Before that it arrived by the walk — a two-line re-export in
 * `packages/core/vitest.config.ts`, or, for a package with no config of its own
 * (`packages/app-shell`), Vitest looking for `vitest.config.*` / `vite.config.*`
 * in each directory from its root upward and taking the first hit.
 *
 * Measured on `main` at eb5f8cea0, `@object-ui/core#test`:
 *
 *     baseline                                  2e2087e2c30ef125
 *     after touching vitest.config.mts          2e2087e2c30ef125   <- frozen
 *     after touching vitest.setup.base.ts       2e2087e2c30ef125   <- frozen
 *     after touching vitest.setup.dom.tsx       2e2087e2c30ef125   <- frozen
 *     after touching scripts/vitest-invocation-guard.mjs
 *                                               2e2087e2c30ef125   <- frozen
 *     after touching packages/core/src/index.ts 55923ba1954a7352   (control)
 *
 * Worse than the `type-check` instance in two ways. A package's `type-check`
 * reaches out only where a tsconfig says so, whereas every package's test run
 * goes through the shared Vitest configuration by construction. And the root
 * config is not passive data: it calls `assertCanonicalVitestInvocation` from
 * `scripts/vitest-invocation-guard.mjs`, which decides whether a run is
 * REFUSED at all (objectui#3378 / objectui#3288). A stale replay of a `test`
 * task is a replay of that judgement too.
 *
 * So this defect DERIVES its requirement rather than restating it, the way the
 * `type-check` sibling does — but from a different program, and by a different
 * mechanism. The derivation lives in `./helpers/vitest-config-program.ts`,
 * which assembles each package's Vitest configuration program: the config file
 * Vitest resolves for its `test` script, that program's transitive relative
 * imports, and the files it designates through file-valued Vitest options.
 * That module's docblock carries the mechanism and its stated narrowings; this
 * file carries only the policy over the result.
 *
 * The policy: every file in that program that lands outside the package
 * directory must be matched by a `$TURBO_ROOT$` input, or this test reds naming
 * the package, the file, and the entry to add. Two assertions police the
 * reverse direction (an entry matching nothing on disk, an entry no program
 * requires any more), one pins the derivation's own liveness, and two pin the
 * config-resolution premise the whole sweep rests on.
 *
 * The turbo-side plumbing is shared with the sibling guard via
 * `./helpers/turbo-inputs.ts`; only the derivation differs, and it differs in
 * kind.
