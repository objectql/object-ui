/**
 * The network-escape ledger is RETIRED — and stays retired (objectui#6640, #7307).
 *
 * ## What this file used to be, and why it is not that any more
 *
 * `vitest.setup.network-escape-guard.ts` used to export `KNOWN_ESCAPES`: the
 * burn-down list of what remained of the 21 test files measured reaching a real
 * socket on `67dadd6`. This file was its shrink-only reconcile pin, and it
 * existed because the guard's docstring said the list "may only shrink" while
 * nothing made that true — an author who hit the guard's red could make it green
 * by adding a line, which is how a burn-down ledger decays into the permanent
 * quarantine it is not supposed to be.
 *
 * objectui#7307 burned the list down batch by batch (PRs #7999, #8013, #8019,
 * #8032, #8053) and its sixth and last batch emptied it. The old pin's own
 * non-vacuity floor prescribed what to do then, verbatim: "If the ledger
 * genuinely reached zero, that is the win this whole instrument was built for —
 * delete the guard's KNOWN_ESCAPES machinery and this pin together, rather than
 * leaving a pin that asserts nothing." So the set, the attributed-stderr branch
 * that kept listed files green, and the known/unknown split are all gone.
 *
 * ## Why a retirement pin rather than a deleted file
 *
 * The pressure the old pin resisted did not end with the list; it went UP. Every
 * escape is now red on its first run with no list to join, so the cheapest wrong
 * fix available to the next author who meets that red is to RE-CREATE the list —
 * a one-line, green-on-arrival change that would silently re-open a tolerated
 * path for the whole repo. That is the same failure the old pin was written for,
 * one step later, and deleting this file would leave nothing resisting it.
 *
 * So this file now pins the ABSENCE of the machinery, plus the presence of the
 * STANDING guard that was never part of the burn-down: the recording `fetch`
 * wrapper and the `afterEach` that fails ANY escape in ANY file. Re-adding a
 * list is red here; deleting the guard while deleting the list is red here too.
 *
 * ## How it reads the guard, and why not with a regex
 *
 * The absence assertions run over the guard's source with COMMENTS BLANKED, via
 * `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs` — the tree's one answer to "comment, or code?".
 * That is load-bearing rather than tidy: the guard's own header now explains at
 * length that there is no `KNOWN_ESCAPES` any more, so a naive text search finds
 * the name in prose and this pin could never go green. Masking makes the
 * assertion about CODE, which is what it means.
 *
 * Every negative below is paired with a positive control on the same read, so a
 * mistyped path or an empty read cannot pass as "the thing is absent".
