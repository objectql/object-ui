/**
 * Derives a workspace package's **Vitest configuration program** — the set of
 * files Vitest reads in order to know how that package's tests run.
 *
 * Extracted as its own module rather than folded into the guard that consumes
 * it (`../turbo-test-inputs.test.ts`, objectui#4178) for two reasons. It is a
 * mechanism, not a policy: the guard decides what must be true of the result,
 * this file decides only what the result IS. And a derivation that can only be
 * exercised through the assertions it feeds is a derivation nobody can probe —
 * which is how a sweep quietly degrades to returning nothing while every
 * assertion over it stays green.
 *
 * ## The program
 *
 *  1. The config file Vitest resolves for the package's `test` script,
 *     following the script's own `--root` / `--config` flags and then Vitest's
 *     upward search.
 *  2. Every file that program statically imports by RELATIVE specifier,
 *     transitively.
 *  3. Every file it DESIGNATES through a file-valued Vitest option
 *     (`setupFiles`, `globalSetup`, `projects`, `workspace`) — themselves
 *     walked as program files, which is how `vitest.setup.tsx` pulls in the
 *     `vitest.setup.dom.tsx` it imports, and how the root config's `projects`
 *     entry pulls in `apps/console/vitest.config.ts` and the two
 *     `scripts/vite-*.ts` plugins that one imports.
 *
 * Steps 2 and 3 are the generic walk, shared with the ESLint and build
 * derivations since objectui#4184 / objectui#4185: see `./config-program.ts`,
 * whose docblock carries the narrowings all of them share (bare specifiers not
 * followed, designation key-directed, unresolvable designated paths throw).
 * What is specific to Vitest, and lives here, is only which file the walk
 * STARTS from and which option names designate files.
 *
 * ## Narrowings specific to this derivation
 *
 *  - THE CONFIGURATION PROGRAM, not the module closure of the tests. Vitest
 *    resolves `@object-ui/*` through the root config's alias table straight to
 *    other packages' `src/`, so the true read set of any package's test run is
 *    most of the repository. Requiring that is not a stricter version of this
 *    derivation, it is a different (and wrong) one — turbo's
 *    `dependsOn: ["^build"]` and per-package `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` already answer
 *    source. The failure being guarded is "change the SHARED TEST HARNESS, get
 *    a stale verdict", and the harness is exactly this program.
 *  - The root config holds ~45 concrete test-file paths in `domTsTests` /
 *    `heavyDomTests`; those are `include` / `exclude` inputs to project
 *    definitions, covered by their own packages' inputs — not files this
 *    program reads. That is the key-directed rule in action.
