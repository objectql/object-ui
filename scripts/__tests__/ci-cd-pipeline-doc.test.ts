/**
 * objectui#3197: `content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md` described a bundle-size
 * regime that had not existed for a long time — a 60 KB console budget against a
 * workflow that enforces 350 KB (5.8x off), a `size-check.yml` workflow that has
 * never existed in this repository, and three package-size tiers printed under an
 * **Enforced limits** heading even though the step that emits them compares
 * nothing and never exits non-zero.
 *
 * Prose cannot be trusted to stay in sync with YAML by review alone — the number
 * had already drifted once and would drift again. So the doc is pinned to the
 * workflow here: change `MAX_ENTRY_GZIP_KB` (or the advisory tiers, or the set of
 * workflows the page names) without updating the page and this test fails.
 *
 * The dangerous direction is deliberately covered twice. A doc that *understates*
 * a gate is annoying; a doc that advertises a guardrail the CI does not have is
 * worse than no doc, because people make size decisions believing something will
 * stop them. Hence the last block: if anyone ever makes the size report actually
 * enforce those tiers, this test fails and points at the page that calls them
 * advisory.
