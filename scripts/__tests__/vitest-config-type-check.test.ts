/**
 * objectui#7328 — the repo-root `vitest.config.mts` had no RUNNABLE gate.
 *
 * Not "no program": `apps/console/tsconfig.node.json` has listed
 * `../../vitest.config.mts` and `vitest.config.ts` since objectui#3476, and that
 * program is exactly the compiler that catches drift in the one file which
 * merges two config objects. What was missing was a way to RUN it. The only
 * invocation was the console's own `type-check` script — `tsc --noEmit && tsc -b
 * tsconfig.node.json --force` — reached through `turbo run type-check`, whose
 * task `dependsOn: ["^build"]`. So the cheapest compiler in the repo that reads
 * the root Vitest config was reachable only behind a full workspace build, and
 * every local gate union short of that was structurally unable to go red on it.
 *
 * PR #7291 is the measured cost: a conditionally spread `dist` project whose
 * literal `extends: true` widened to `boolean` degraded the whole `projects`
 * array to `never[]`; `type-check:scripts`, `type-check:vitest-setup` and the
 * vitest runs were all green, and CI answered with three errors, two of them
 * reported at `../../vitest.config.mts`.
 *
 * `type-check:vitest-config` closes it by giving that program its own runner.
 * This file is what stops it reopening, and like its siblings
 * `scripts-type-check.test.ts` and `vitest-setup-type-check.test.ts` it asserts
 * BEHAVIOUR — which files the project really resolves, whether CI really runs
 * it, and where — rather than the spelling of any config. A test that only read
 * spellings would be satisfied by an `include` entry matching nothing, which is
 * the objectui#3476 failure one door over: a literal, glob-less `include` entry
 * that matches no file is silently ignored by TypeScript and reads as coverage
 * that was never there.
 *
 * ⚠️ The `.mts` trap this card was triaged against belongs here too. Neither
 * root program's globs admit the extension — `tsconfig.scripts.json` includes
 * `scripts/**\/*.ts` and `tsconfig.vitest-setup.json` `./vitest.setup*.ts(x)` —
 * so "add an include entry" was never the fix, and the assertion below asks
 * TypeScript whether the `.mts` file is in the resolved program rather than
 * whether some string names it.
