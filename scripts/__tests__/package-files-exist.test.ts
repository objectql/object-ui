/**
 * objectui#3663: nothing in this repo ever checked that the paths a package
 * PROMISES to ship in `package.json` `files` actually exist on disk.
 *
 * npm skips a missing `files` entry **silently** — no error, no warning, exit
 * code 0. `npm publish`, `npm pack` and CI are all green while the tarball
 * quietly lacks something the manifest says is in it. There is no output to
 * read, so the drift is not "hard to notice", it is *invisible*.
 *
 * objectui#3647 is that mechanism's specimen: `@object-ui/plugin-tree` listed
 * `"LICENSE"` in `files` while `packages/plugin-tree/LICENSE` did not exist.
 * Every published tarball shipped without the MIT text its own manifest
 * promised, for the package's entire life, and the only reason anyone found out
 * is that a human diffed all 39 packages' `files` fields by hand while chasing
 * an unrelated README problem (objectui#3622). PR #3662 restored the file; this
 * guard is what makes the next one impossible to miss.
 *
 * ## Why the check cannot simply be "the path exists"
 *
 * 40 of the 159 declared entries are BUILD OUTPUT (`dist`, `apps/console`'s
 * `plugin.js`/`plugin.d.ts`). In an unbuilt worktree — which is what CI has when
 * this test runs, and what a contributor has after a fresh clone — those are
 * legitimately absent. Demanding they exist would make the guard fail for
 * everyone always, and a guard that is always red gets deleted or `.skip`ped.
 *
 * So an absent entry is forgiven only when the repo has ALREADY DECLARED,
 * elsewhere and for its own reasons, that the path is generated:
 *
 *   1. it is git-ignored (`.gitignore` says the build writes here), AND
 *   2. it is not git-tracked (a force-added ignored file is a real file and
 *      must exist), AND
 *   3. its package has a `build` script (a package that builds nothing cannot
 *      be about to generate anything).
 *
 * That criterion is DERIVED, never hand-listed. The alternative — a whitelist of
 * blessed entry names in this file — would have to be edited to stay correct,
 * and the edit that silences a real defect looks exactly like the edit that
 * teaches the guard about a new build directory. Deriving it means the only way
 * to exempt a path is to state in `.gitignore` that a build produces it, which
 * is a reviewable claim that is wrong in an obvious way when it is wrong.
 *
 * ## What this guard deliberately does NOT prove
 *
 * That a build output is really produced. Proving that needs an actual build,
 * which is not a static check's job; `dist` is taken on the repo's word here.
 * The gap is narrow and named on purpose: the whole objectui#3647 family —
 * source files (LICENSE, README, CHANGELOG, `src`, `templates`) declared and
 * absent — is inside this guard, and that is where the drift has actually
 * happened.

/**

 *
 * A RATCHET, not an allowlist, in the shape
 * `scripts/i18n-call-site-key-baseline.json` established: a NEW violation fails
 * the build, and an entry here whose defect is GONE fails it too, so this map
 * can only shrink. Fix one by deleting the stale `files` entry from the
 * package's `package.json` and deleting its line here.
 *
 * Currently empty, which is the intended resting state — the ratchet still
 * fails on any NEW violation. It landed carrying two entries measured on
 * main@dae1ac41e, `packages/cli/templates` and
 * `packages/create-plugin/templates`: vestigial declarations for directories
 * that never existed on disk, never existed anywhere in this repo's git
 * history, and that no build step or workflow creates. Both packages inline
 * their templates instead. objectui#3665 banked both by deleting the two
 * `files` entries, and deleting a declaration retires a baseline line exactly

/**
 * objectui#3696: the guard above can only ask whether a path a package
 * PROMISED in `files` is real. A package that never made the promise is
 * invisible to it — and the license text is exactly the file nobody promises,
 * because npm ships it whether you list it or not.
 *
 * ## Why `files` is the wrong place to look for this one
 *
 * npm keeps a small set of paths it packs REGARDLESS of `files`:
 * `package.json`, `README*`, `LICENSE*`/`LICENCE*`, `COPYING*`, and the `main`
 * entry. Measured on `packages/sdui-parser` (which declares `files: ["dist"]`)
 * by renaming one file and re-running `npm pack --dry-run`:
 *
 *   LICENSE / License / LICENCE / LICENSE.md / LICENSE.txt -> packed
 *   copying                                                -> packed
 *   NOTICE / CHANGELOG.md / NOTALICENSE                     -> NOT packed
 *
 * So `files: ["dist"]` never excluded the license text, and adding `"LICENSE"`
 * to `files` would not have included it. `@object-ui/react-runtime` and
 * `@object-ui/sdui-parser` shipped every version of themselves declaring
 * `"license": "MIT"` with no MIT text and no copyright notice in the tarball,
 * for one reason only: the file was not on disk. That is what this guard reads.
 *
 * ## The predicate
 *
 * `!private && license` — the two conditions that together turn "MIT" from a
 * label into an obligation. A private package makes no distribution and owes no
 * text (`object-ui`, the vscode-extension, is exactly that case and is excluded
 * on purpose). A package declaring no license at all is a different defect that
 * this guard deliberately does not invent a verdict about.
 *
 * The population is DERIVED from the same workspace scan as the guard above, so
 * a 40th package is covered the day it is added rather than the day someone
 * repeats the by-hand census. objectui#3647 and objectui#3696 were both found
 * by a human diffing every package by hand; twice in one week is the argument
 * for a gate, not for more care.

/**
 * objectui#4059: the two guards above ask whether a path a package promised in
 * `files` is real, and whether a package that claims a license ships its text.
 * Neither can see the OTHER promise a manifest makes — `exports`.
 *
 * ## The specimen
 *
 * `@object-ui/fields` declared
 *
 *   "exports": { "./style.css": "./dist/index.css" }
 *
 * while `scripts.build` was `tsc && vite build`, `src` held no `.css` file at
 * all, and nothing anywhere produced `dist/index.css`. Every published tarball
 * up to and including 17.3.0 contained ZERO `.css` files. A consumer writing the
 * `@import '@object-ui/fields/style.css'` that `content/docs/guide/quick-start.md`
 * taught did not get a badly-styled page — the specifier failed to resolve and
 * took their build down.
 *
 * Nothing in this repo noticed for the package's entire life, and the reason is
 * structural rather than careless: no in-repo consumer imports the subpath.
 * `apps/console`, `examples/console-starter` and `examples/byo-backend-console`
 * all reach fields' SOURCE through `@source '.../packages/fields/src/**'`, a
 * workspace-relative path no published consumer can write. So the repo's own
 * rendering proved nothing about the artifact, and the export was free to lie.
 *
 * ## Why the objectui#3663 guard above does not already cover this
 *
 * It would forgive this defect, correctly, under its own rules: `dist/index.css`
 * is git-ignored, untracked, and `@object-ui/fields` has a `build` script, so the
 * path is "declared build output" and taken on the repo's word. That guard says
 * so itself — *"What this guard deliberately does NOT prove: that a build output
 * is really produced."* This section closes exactly that gap for the one file
 * type where the question is decidable statically.
 *
 * ## The two questions asked here
 *
 *   1. **Packability.** Is the target inside something `files` ships? An export
 *      pointing outside the packed set can never resolve, whatever the build
 *      does. (`@object-ui/app-shell` is the live positive case: it exports
 *      `./styles.css` -> `./src/styles.css` and lists `src/styles.css` in `files`
 *      precisely so the subpath resolves.)
 *   2. **Producibility, for stylesheets.** A `.css` target that is not on disk
 *      has to be generated by something. Unlike `dist/index.js` — which any
 *      bundler build emits by construction — a stylesheet appears only if the
 *      package has a CSS source in its entry graph or an explicit CSS build
 *      step. Both are readable from the manifest and the tree, so this one does
 *      not need a build to answer.
 *
 * `.js`/`.d.ts` targets are deliberately NOT given a producibility test: there is
 * no honest static answer for them, and a guard that guessed would either be
 * noise or a false green. The gap is named rather than papered over — same
 * discipline as the objectui#3663 block above.
