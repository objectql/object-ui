/**
 * objectui#6577 — cache bookkeeping voided a verdict the gate had already
 * recorded.
 *
 * On 2026-08-26 the merge-group build of #6571 was ejected from the queue with
 * `CI_FAILURE` while every substantive check passed. All 21 real steps of the
 * `Type Check` job succeeded — `Run type-check` reported success at 13:31:31Z —
 * and then `Post Turbo Cache`, the save phase of `actions/cache@v6`, spent
 * 13m09s (789s) inside the upload and was still there when the job's
 * `timeout-minutes: 20` fired at 20m02s. The job went `cancelled`, the merge
 * queue cannot tell `cancelled` from `failure`, and a pull request that had
 * passed was dequeued. It was transient, not structural: the same job on the
 * same PR head thirteen minutes earlier went green in 5m53s with a cache save
 * of ONE SECOND.
 *
 * The ordering is the whole point, and it is what this file exists to keep
 * true: the verdict is recorded by the job's command steps; everything after
 * them is bookkeeping. Bookkeeping must be bounded, and its failure must not
 * be able to speak for the code.
 *
 * Why this needs a pin at all — the fix is invisible when reverted. Folding
 * the split back into one `actions/cache` step, or dropping either key from
 * the save, restores the defect with nothing going red: the cache still works,
 * every run still passes, and the next transient upload stall ejects the next
 * green pull request. That is this repository's recurring "looks like
 * enforcement, isn't" class (objectui#3009, #3181, #3494), and it is why the
 * sibling #5304 apt fix shipped with `ensure-chromium-ready.test.ts` beside it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: that the restore half is bounded. A restore stall
 * fails BEFORE any verdict exists — a gate that did not run, which is honest —
 * rather than a recorded verdict discarded, and bounding it would force a cold
 * check under the same job ceiling. That is a different card if it ever fires.
