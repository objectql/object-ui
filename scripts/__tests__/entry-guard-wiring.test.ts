/**
 * objectui#6092: `scripts/invoked-as.mjs` arrived from objectstack (#5984)
 * carrying a header that named `scripts/check-entry-guard.mjs` as the gate
 * enforcing its single-spelling rule. That file did not exist here, nothing in
 * `package.json` or `.github/workflows/` ran such a gate, and the sweep the
 * header described had not happened either — the string `check-entry-guard`
 * appeared in exactly one place in the whole repository, which was that
 * sentence about itself (objectui#6078).
 *
 * The failure that made it expensive was not the missing file. It was that a
 * reader — human or agent — could open `invoked-as.mjs`, read a confident
 * present-tense claim, and conclude the tree was converted and enforced when
 * neither was true. So this file pins the claim to the mechanism, in the one
 * direction that can go wrong quietly: a gate can stop being wired without
 * anything going red, because a gate nobody runs is indistinguishable from a
 * gate that passes.
 *
 * What is asserted, and why each one:
 *
 *   1. the script exists and its `package.json` alias points at it — the alias
 *      is what a developer runs, and an alias naming a moved file fails loudly
 *      only if something runs it;
 *   2. `lint.yml` really runs it, on pull requests, in a step that executes —
 *      the wiring claim itself;
 *   3. the workflow's spelling and the alias's spelling name the SAME script,
 *      so the pre-install `node` invocation and `pnpm check:entry-guard` cannot
 *      drift into checking different things;
 *   4. it runs BEFORE `pnpm install`, which is not decoration: placed after,
 *      an install failure would take the gate with it and the tree would go
 *      unjudged with the job red for an unrelated reason;
 *   5. the gate's own `--self-test` is what the workflow runs first, and it
 *      passes — a scan whose recogniser is broken reports a clean tree.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: any count of guards, spellings or baseline
 * entries. Those numbers live in the gate's output and its baseline, they move
 * as objectui#6092's second half converts call sites, and a hand-copied
 * enumeration here would drift by construction — the lesson `lint-workflow.test.ts`
 * records at length for this same workflow.
