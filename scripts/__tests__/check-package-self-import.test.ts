/**
 * objectui#4801 — a file inside a package must not name its OWN package.
 *
 * The specifier is legal and it resolves: through the package's own `exports`
 * map, to `dist/`. What does not exist is an ORDERING — turbo gives `type-check`
 * `dependsOn: ["^build"]`, the DEPENDENCIES' builds, never the package's own —
 * so on a cold cache the declarations the specifier points at have not been
 * produced yet and the file fails with TS2307. PR #4789's first CI run was red
 * on exactly one line of exactly this shape in `packages/fields/src`.
 *
 * The reason it needs a gate rather than a review note is that no local workflow
 * can see it: every one of them builds before it type-checks, and
 * `pnpm --filter '<pkg>^...' build` leaves a `dist/` behind for any package that
 * is also someone else's dependency. Green everywhere, red in CI, once per
 * occurrence, at a cost of a full CI round plus a rework round.
 *
 * What this file pins, in the order the gate can go wrong:
 *
 *  1. **A package name inside a STRING LITERAL is not a module edge.** This is
 *     the reason the gate parses instead of grepping, and the counter-examples
 *     are live in this repository — `packages/i18n/src/__tests__` carries an
 *     import statement as fixture TEXT, `packages/layout/src/__tests__` assigns
 *     its own package name to a const it writes into a temp entry file.
 *  2. **The verdicts**, over throwaway package trees rather than this
 *     repository, so they stay decidable when the workspace moves.
 *  3. **The exemption table is re-derived, never trusted.** An entry whose site
 *     has gone silently widens the hole for the next file that lands there.
 *  4. **The scope cannot collapse quietly.** An empty walk would make every
 *     assertion vacuous, so it throws.
 *  5. **This repository is green, and the sites objectui#4801 converted stay
 *     converted** — including the `tsconfig.test.json` workaround that existed
 *     only to make one of them compile.
 *  6. **The gate is wired** where the sibling parse-based gates are.

/**
 * THE repository scan — computed exactly once, here, and judged many times below.
 *
 * Two assertions in this file are about this repository under DIFFERENT exemption
 * tables (the repository's own, and none at all), and one of them used to call
 * `analyze(repoRoot)` from inside an `it()`. That is a full TypeScript parse of
 * every source file of every workspace package — ~3,100 files, ~30 MB, ~15,500
 * module specifiers — and doing it twice is exactly the same work twice, because
 * the parse does not depend on the exemption table at all.
 *
 * It fits in the 15-second `testTimeout` uninstrumented (measured 8.8 s) and does
 * NOT fit under coverage (measured 41.3 s), which is why `ci.yml`'s
 * `Test (coverage)` job failed 100% of the time for four days — 50 of 51 completed
 * jobs, all on this file, all `Test timed out in 15000ms`. `@vitest/coverage-v8`
 * arms V8 precise coverage in the worker BEFORE test modules and their
 * dependencies compile; V8 emits those block counters at compile time and does so
 * isolate-wide, so `node_modules/typescript` is instrumented too (`coverage.exclude`
 * filters the report, never the instrumentation). Measured on this repository, the
 * identical parse costs 4.1-4.9 s uninstrumented and 32-35 s when coverage was
 * armed first: a 7x constant factor landing squarely on the parser.
 *
 * So the rule for anything added to this file: **judge `repoScan`, never rescan.**
 * `judgeScan()` is pure and costs microseconds; `analyze(repoRoot)` and
 * `scanRepository(repoRoot)` cost a full parse and must not appear inside an
 * `it()`. Module scope is deliberate — collection is not bounded by
 * `testTimeout`, and this scan is the file's one unavoidable cost.
 *
 * (objectui#5402. `analyze()` over a throwaway FIXTURE tree stays fine and is used
 * throughout — those trees hold a handful of tiny files.)
