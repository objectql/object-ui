/**
 * objectui#8099: the toolchain download is one thing, so it lives in one place —
 * and this file is what keeps the fourteenth workflow from being written without
 * it.
 *
 * ## What happened
 *
 * A Corepack fetch of the pinned pnpm tarball died inside undici ten seconds into
 * a job, reddening the REQUIRED check `README Export Check` on a one-file prose
 * diff. `rerun_failed_jobs` on the same head turned it green with no code change.
 * `scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs` classifies that check as a required
 * context, and since objectui#6160 the `merge_group` floor derives from that
 * list — so on the queue leg this is a 60-minute stall, not one re-run.
 *
 * ## Why a WIRING pin and not just the fix
 *
 * The fix itself is exercised by `bash scripts/ci-setup-pnpm.sh --self-test`,
 * which stubs the registry read and drives the real retry loop. ⛔ This file
 * deliberately restates none of that.
 *
 * What it pins is the property the card was actually about: BREADTH. Thirteen
 * workflows ran `corepack enable` when this landed and any one of them could be
 * reddened by the same blip. A one-workflow fix would have left twelve exposed
 * AND made the next occurrence harder to recognise, because the obvious
 * precedent would look already-handled. A sweep is a one-time act; nothing stops
 * a fourteenth workflow being typed with a bare `corepack enable` tomorrow, and
 * that workflow would be silently back on the unprotected path.
 *
 * ## The four properties, and the direction each can fail quietly
 *
 *   1. The script exists and is executable — a workflow calling a missing file
 *      fails loudly, but only once someone opens a PR.
 *   2. No `run:` step spells `corepack` directly. This is the breadth rule, and
 *      it reads `run:` BODIES only: two workflows (`changelog.yml`,
 *      `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`) mention `corepack enable` in COMMENTS, one of
 *      them recording the objectui#6392 ruling that removed the step because
 *      nothing in that job calls pnpm. ⛔ Those comments are not violations and
 *      an anchored or whole-file scan would call them one.
 *   3. Every workflow that invokes `pnpm` in a `run:` step also calls the setup
 *      script. This is the direction a NEW workflow fails: it needs pnpm, copies
 *      a setup from somewhere, and misses this line.
 *   4. Every job calling the script checks the repository out first. The script
 *      is a repo file; a job that runs it before `actions/checkout` fails at
 *      `No such file or directory`, and that ordering is invisible to a reader
 *      scanning for the step's presence.
 *
 * ## Anti-vacuity
 *
 * Each population is asserted non-empty in the same run that judges it. A
 * renamed directory, a changed step spelling or a regex that stops matching
 * would otherwise turn every assertion here into a green taken over nothing —
 * which is the failure mode this repository has recorded more than once.
