/**
 * The pin on `changesets/action`'s ref in
 * `.github/workflows/changeset-release.yml` (objectui#6081).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * `.github/workflows/**` is read by nothing else in this repository: not the
 * type checker, not the linters, not a schema. So a deliberate bump of that
 * action lands with no mechanical objection anywhere — and two lanes of that
 * workflow are built on properties asserted against **v1's source**:
 *
 *   (1) THE DISPATCH TABLE. `!hasChangesets && hasPublishScript -> runPublish`
 *       (v1's `src/index.ts`). The "Clear pending changesets for the publish
 *       branch" step exists ONLY because the action picks its branch from
 *       repository state rather than from an input. If a later major takes an
 *       explicit instruction instead, that step is not a workaround to keep —
 *       it is dead weight, and keeping it would be the bug.
 *   (2) `runPublish` NEVER COMMITS AND NEVER PUSHES A BRANCH. Verified in v1's
 *       `src/run.ts`: the only git operation inside `runPublish` is
 *       `git.pushTag()` (lines 124 and 146); `git.prepareBranch()` (line 290)
 *       and `git.pushChanges()` (line 362) occur solely inside `runVersion`.
 *       THIS is what makes the clear step's deletion safe — it cannot leave the
 *       runner. v2 pushes via the GitHub API by default, which would put this
 *       property back in question rather than preserve it.
 *
 * Neither property is checkable from here. What IS checkable is the ref, so a
 * bump fails loudly and prompts someone to re-establish both before shipping.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion lives in its own file
 *
 * It used to be one `it()` inside `changeset-release-lane-mirror.test.ts`,
 * whose subject was the `lane` job's bash mirror of the action's file scan.
 * objectui#6081 deleted that mirror — but the ref pin was never about the
 * mirror. It guards property (1), which the clear step keeps depending on after
 * the mirror is gone. Deleting the mirror's test file wholesale would therefore
 * have removed the only thing in the repository that notices an action bump, in
 * the same commit that closed the hole the bump would widen. Hence a file whose
 * subject is the ref itself, which no future cleanup of something else can take
 * with it by accident.
 *
 * ⛔ If you are deleting this file, you are deleting the only mechanical guard
 * on that ref. Move the assertion somewhere that survives first — do not just
 * drop it.
 *
 * ## What this pin does NOT do
 *
 * It cannot catch a **retag of `v1` in place**. `changesets/action@v1` is a
 * moving tag whose bundled `@changesets/read` is a minified chunk nothing here
 * installs, so no test can execute it and no lockfile records it — that gap is
 * objectui#6081's subject, and it is the reason the mirror was deleted rather
 * than given a better referent. This pin catches the DELIBERATE bump, which is
 * the only moment anyone can act on anyway.

 * is a different action path AND a different major, and a pin that only looked
