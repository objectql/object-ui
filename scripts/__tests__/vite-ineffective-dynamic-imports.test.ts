/**
 * objectui#5325 — the console build emits 43 true-but-unactionable
 * `INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT` warnings. They are pinned to a ledger rather
 * than filtered away, so the signal survives and drift in EITHER direction
 * fails the build.
 *
 * This file tests the policy half. The graph half — which module ids rolldown
 * actually reports — is only exercisable by a real console build, exactly as
 * `scripts/check-eager-closure-budget.mjs` splits policy from
 * `emitEagerClosureReport`'s graph walk in `apps/console/vite.config.ts`.
 *
 * The plugin's hooks are ordinary functions on the returned object, though, so
 * the DECISION they make is driven directly here against a stub context (see
 * `drive` below). objectui#6093 turned that from a nicety into a requirement:
 * whether `closeBundle` throws is now conditional, and the condition has three
 * outcomes that a five-minute console build is a terrible way to check.
