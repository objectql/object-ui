/**
 * objectui#3515 — the four repo-ROOT `vitest.setup.*` files were in zero tsc
 * programs.
 *
 * They live at the repo root, outside every workspace package, so `pnpm
 * type-check` (`turbo run type-check`, driven by package.json `scripts`)
 * structurally cannot reach them. The root `tsconfig.json` includes only
 * `packages`/`examples`/`apps`; `tsconfig.scripts.json` only `scripts/**`. And
 * nothing IMPORTS them — every consumer names them as a Vitest `setupFiles`
 * runtime path string, so no gated program has a type edge to them either. The
 * only program that did contain them, the root `tsconfig.node.json`, has no
 * `include` (it therefore compiles the entire repository, currently ~21.6k
 * errors) and no script runs it: not a gate.
 *
 * That matters because `vitest.setup.dom.tsx` decides which package graphs get
 * registered before the `dom-heavy` project runs. Drift there does not fail as a
 * type error — it fails as a confusing "component not registered" in whichever
 * test happened to depend on the registration.
 *
 * `tsconfig.vitest-setup.json` closes it. This file is what stops it reopening,
 * and like its sibling `scripts-type-check.test.ts` it asserts BEHAVIOUR — which
 * files the project actually resolves, whether CI actually runs it, and in the
 * right place — rather than the config's spelling. A test that only checked the
 * spelling would be satisfied by a config that compiles nothing, which is the
 * exact failure mode it exists to prevent.
