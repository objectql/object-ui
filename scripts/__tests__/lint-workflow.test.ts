/**
 * objectui#3261: the header comment in `.github/workflows/lint.yml` said
 * `eslint.config.js` sets *three* `object-ui/*` rules to `error` and named the
 * three sources they came from. The config had four. The parenthesised list of
 * sources was short by one for the same reason.
 *
 * Miscounting is the visible symptom, not the defect. That comment is the only
 * written explanation of why `lint.yml` exists at all — it records that those
 * `error` ratchets sat inert for months because the workflow was
 * `workflow_dispatch`-only until #2923. The next person adding an `error`-level
 * rule reads it to decide what this gate covers, and a stale enumeration reads
 * exactly as authoritative as a fresh one: it will tell them their new rule is
 * outside the gate (or inside it) with equal confidence, and be wrong.
 *
 * A hand-copied enumeration drifts by construction; #3212 measured the same
 * page's workflow count at 11 in the doc, 12 in the issue and 13 in reality on
 * a single day. So the comment no longer counts or names anything, and this
 * file is what keeps it that way — plus it pins the two claims the comment
 * still makes, so the prose cannot quietly become fiction:
 *
 *   1. the enumeration does not come back (the #3261 regression itself);
 *   2. `eslint.config.js` really does set `object-ui/*` rules to `error`,
 *      otherwise the comment describes a gate that no longer has anything to
 *      gate;
 *   3. this workflow really does run on pull requests, otherwise those rules
 *      are inert again exactly as they were before #2923 — and the comment
 *      would be describing the bug as history while it is live.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: that a *list* of the rules somewhere matches the
 * config. Keeping such a list is the thing this issue removed — the generic
 * phrasing ("the rules `eslint.config.js` sets to `error`") is always true, so
 * the only honest list is the config itself.
 *
 * ## The scan surface, and why it is a list (objectui#3279)
 *
 * That sentence existed a third time, verbatim, in the header docblock of
 * `scripts/check-lint-coverage.mjs`: same hand-count, same parenthesised source
 * list, short the same rule. #3261 rewrote only the workflow, so the copy
 * outlived the fix and was found by someone reading the file for an unrelated
 * reason (#3274) rather than by a gate. Both files are scanned now — the two
 * assertions iterate a list of prose surfaces — so a fourth copy fails CI
 * instead of waiting on the next accidental reading. Any future file arguing
 * from the same facts belongs in that list, not in a copy of this test.
 *
 * The count pattern reads each file's explanatory comment only, never the whole
 * file, and for the script that scoping is load-bearing rather than tidiness:
 * its `Known gaps` comment legitimately counts *packages* ("the last two …, 14
 * errors"), which the pattern would otherwise report as a rule count. The
 * rule-name pattern does read the whole file — a rule name anywhere in either
 * file is the same second copy of `eslint.config.js`, wherever it sits.
