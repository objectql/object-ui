/**
 * ObjectUI — the `thresholds` closure claim, re-derived (objectui#6186 claim 2)
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 *
 * `packages/sdui-parser/src/dashboard-widget-options.ts` warns on a dashboard
 * widget `options` key that reaches no renderer. Its census header names
 * `thresholds` as the headline case, and the reason the warning is allowed to
 * fire on it is a CLOSURE CLAIM: nothing in this repository reads a
 * `thresholds` key. That claim used to be written TWICE — once in the census
 * header and once, in its own words, on
 * `content/docs/plugins/plugin-dashboard.mdx`. Two copies of one closure claim
 * drift apart independently, and neither copy knows when the other stops being
 * true.
 *
 * The 2026-08-25 maintainer ruling (batch adjudication close-out, decision B1)
 * settled what a doc may assert about a population it does not own: **bounded
 * or derivable**. A closure claim must either name a bounded population, or be
 * backed by a gate that re-derives it. A claim written in two places is
 * single-sourced — one copy states it, the other points.
 *
 * So: the census header is now the CANONICAL statement, the page points at it,
 * and single-sourcing is exactly what makes the surviving copy load-bearing.
 * This file is the other half of the ruling — it re-derives the claim from
 * source on every test run instead of trusting the paragraph that states it.
 *
 * ⛔ Why not a `toContain` pin on the prose. That is the defect objectui#6186
 * filed one level up: a test asserting a sentence is PRESENT cannot assert the
 * sentence is TRUE, and a green presence pin reads as coverage of the claim it
 * quotes. Land a renderer that reads the key tomorrow and a presence pin stays
 * green while the census, the warning and the page all turn false together.
 *
 * ## What the instrument can and cannot see — read before trusting a verdict
 *
 * It is a TEXT scan over comment- and literal-masked code, so it answers "does
 * any site in this repository access a key named `thresholds`". It matches the
 * three spellings an access can take — member (`x.thresholds`, including
 * optional chaining), computed with a literal key (`x['thresholds']`), and
 * destructured (`const { thresholds } = x`).
 *
 * Two stated biases, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - **A member-access WRITE matches too** (`x.thresholds = 1`). The claim is
 *    about reads, so this is the red-on-a-true-claim direction — accepted
 *    because a site that puts the key onto an object is something a human
 *    should look at before the warning keeps firing, and because no such site
 *    exists in this tree.
 *  - **A computed access through a VARIABLE key is invisible** (`x[k]` where
 *    `k === 'thresholds'`). Nothing can see that textually. The census test's
 *    leg 2 covers the one file where it would matter by REFUSING the shape:
 *    `packages/sdui-parser/src/__tests__/dashboard-widget-options-census.test.ts`
 *    fails loudly if `DatasetWidget.tsx` ever gains a computed access, a spread
 *    or a destructuring of the options bag.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO masks, because the three spellings need different ones — measured,
 * not assumed: the positive control below caught this file getting it wrong on
 * the first run. A member access and a destructuring are CODE, so both are read
 * off source with comments AND string literals blanked; a mention of the key
 * inside a string is prose there. But a computed access spells its key AS a
 * string literal (`x['thresholds']`), so blanking literals erases the very
 * thing being looked for — that leg reads source with COMMENTS ONLY blanked.
 * Its residual blind spot, stated: a whole computed access quoted inside a
 * string literal would be counted. That is the red-on-a-true-claim direction,
 * it is rare, and it is why the fixture table below spells its self-reference
 * case as a member access.
 *
 * Masking is what lets this scan read its own negative-control table, the
 * census header and this very docblock — all of which spell the key — without
 * reddening on any of them.
 *
 * ## Relationship to the census test
 *
 * They derive different halves and neither does the other's job:
 *
 *  - the census test re-derives the CONSUMED set (what the declared keys are,
 *    and what `DatasetWidget.tsx` really reads) — a claim about one render path;
 *  - this file re-derives the UNCONSUMED claim for `thresholds` — a claim about
 *    the whole repository, which is why it needs the whole repository.
 *
 * ⚠️ `format` and `invert`, the census's other two unconsumed keys, are
 * deliberately NOT scanned this way. Both are live keys in other vocabularies
 * (`measureField(...).format` is how a dataset-bound value is really formatted),
 * so a repo-wide bare scan would red on true claims — the failure the dispatch
 * on this card called the load-bearing risk, because an assertion that reds on
 * legitimate code gets deleted by the next person who hits it, and the claim
 * goes back to unguarded. Their claim is BOUNDED to the dataset-bound path
 * instead, and the census test's leg 2 derives that bound.
