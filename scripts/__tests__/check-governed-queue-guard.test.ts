 * objectui#6596. PR #6183 touched `AGENTS.md`, was correctly parked as a draft,
 * and a GitHub MCP `update_pull_request` call passing only `reviewers` silently
 * set `draft: false`. It entered the merge queue and landed as `5b3290fd5` with
 * no human approval; converting it back to a draft did not dequeue it.
 *
 * The gate itself carries a `--self-test` covering its predicates, and this file
 * does NOT duplicate it — it pins the gate to its WIRING, in the direction that
 * goes wrong quietly. A refusal nothing runs is indistinguishable from a refusal
 * that passes, which is the state the whole governed-surface rule was already in
 * one level up: a rule with no mechanism under it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted here: whether the context is in the live required
 * set. That is repository settings, which no test here can read and no agent may
 * change. What IS asserted is that this repository has written the answer down
 * where its own tooling reads it, and that every piece of the chain exists.
