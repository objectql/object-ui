/**
 * objectui#6535 — six of the eight views `AppContent` declares with `lazy()`
 * were in the console's EAGER closure anyway. This file tests the POLICY half:
 * what is parsed out of AppContent, what may honestly be declared
 * side-effect-free, and which direction of ledger drift fails.
 *
 * The GRAPH half — which module ids rolldown actually reports, and whether
 * `moduleSideEffects` is honoured — is only exercisable by a real console
 * build, exactly as `scripts/check-eager-closure-budget.mjs` splits policy from
 * `emitEagerClosureReport`'s walk in `apps/console/vite.config.ts`.
