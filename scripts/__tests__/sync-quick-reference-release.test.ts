/**
 * objectui#5394 — `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`'s "Current Release" block fossilised once per
 * release, three times (objectui#4642, objectui#4977, objectui#5394). The gate that
 * catches it (`quick-reference-current-release-4143.test.ts`) is correct and untouched;
 * what was missing is anything that MOVES the doc when the anchor moves.
 *
 * The anchor moves inside `changeset version`, run by `changeset-release.yml` with no
 * human present, and the release PR is not a backstop: every `ci.yml` run on branch
 * `changeset-release/main` is `conclusion: "action_required"` with
 * `created_at == run_started_at`, because a `GITHUB_TOKEN`-authored PR does not start
 * workflows. The first thing that ever reads the release is the `push` build on `main`,
 * which is why `main` — not a PR — went red every time.
 *
 * So the fix is a script wired INTO `changeset:version`, and the load-bearing assertion
 * in this file is the wiring one. A sync script nothing calls is exactly as effective as
 * the hand edit it replaces: the first two instances were both fixed by someone who knew
 * the right value and typed it in.
