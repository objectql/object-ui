/**
 * objectui#4929: `@object-ui/plugin-grid` and `@object-ui/plugin-kanban` now
 * publish a stylesheet, built in the subtraction shape `@object-ui/fields`
 * established (objectui#4059).
 *
 * objectui#6438: `@object-ui/fields` is a subject here too. It is the package
 * whose sheet has actually been shipping to consumers since objectui#4059 — the
 * defect this file's shape exists to prevent — and until now it was pinned by
 * nothing in the suite: the builder's four write-time assertions run only during
 * a build, and CI runs this suite on an unbuilt worktree. It could not be a
 * subject earlier because it ran its own copy of the builder and exported no
 * module surface; objectui#6405 re-pointed it at the shared
 * `createPluginStylesheetBuilder`, so it now exports the same shape the two
 * plugins do and the five per-package assertions apply to it unchanged.
 *
 * One asymmetry is deliberate and load-bearing: fields passes a per-package
 * `header` through `buildOptions` (its published banner bytes predate the shared
 * module, and objectui#6405's acceptance gate was that re-pointing it changed
 * `dist/index.css` by not one byte), while the plugins inherit the shared
 * default. Nothing below reads the emitted banner; anything added later that
 * does must take it from `mod.buildOptions`, never from the shared default,
 * or it will judge fields wrongly.
 *
 * ## What has to be pinned, and why a naive test would pass while broken
 *
 * Two properties, and only both together mean anything:
 *
 *   1. the sheet CONTAINS the themed utilities that motivated it — the ones
 *      resolving `@theme` tokens that live in unpublished components source, so
 *      a build inside this monorepo is their only possible producer;
 *   2. the sheet does NOT re-emit what `@object-ui/components` already ships.
 *
 * A sheet built without the subtraction step — the ~164 kB near-copy of the
 * components sheet this shape exists to avoid — satisfies (1) perfectly.
 * "Does it have the class" therefore proves nothing on its own, which is why the
 * degenerate control below asserts a class components DOES carry is ABSENT here,
 * and asserts it against the same package's pre-subtraction compile so the
 * absence cannot be explained by the plugin never using the class.
 *
 * ## Why this test compiles instead of reading `dist/`
 *
 * CI runs the suite on an unbuilt worktree (`ci.yml`'s test job installs and runs
 * `pnpm test`, no build step), so each package's `dist/index.css` is legitimately
 * absent. A test that read the artifact would pass vacuously or be skipped —
 * which is how a stylesheet gate stops being a gate. It runs the real builder
 * instead, over the real sources, and supplies components' sheet compiled from
 * ITS OWN source: `base`-pinned, so byte-identical to what that package's build
 * writes (the vite-extracted `sidebar-fixes.css` it appends carries no utility
 * rule, so nothing this test judges depends on the difference).
