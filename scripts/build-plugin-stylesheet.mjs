 *
 * Builds a plugin package's `dist/index.css` from its `src/index.css` — the
 * shared half of the step each `packages/plugin-<name>/scripts/build-css.mjs` runs.
 *
 * ## What was wrong (objectui#4929)
 *
 * Only `@object-ui/components` and `@object-ui/fields` ever shipped a
 * stylesheet, and each scans its own `src` only. No `@object-ui/plugin-*`
 * package emitted CSS at all (`build: vite build`, no `.css` under `src`), so a
 * class used exclusively by a plugin could not appear in either published sheet
 * BY CONSTRUCTION. A published-state Vite app that installed
 * `@object-ui/plugin-grid` / `plugin-kanban` and followed the quick-start
 * rendered grid and kanban with 25 themed utilities that had no source anywhere
 * in the world — `bg-muted/10`, `bg-card/60`, `text-muted-foreground/60` and
 * friends, ordinary appearance classes — plus ~103 plain ones.
 *
 * The plain utilities a consumer could in principle regenerate by pointing
 * `@source` at the package's `dist`. The themed ones they cannot: they resolve
 * `@theme` tokens declared in `packages/components/src/index.css`, a file that
 * package does not publish. A build inside this monorepo is their only possible
 * producer. That is why the 2026-08-17 ruling chose a stylesheet per plugin over
 * a documentation note teaching consumers to hand-declare the theme and scan
 * `node_modules` — the advice objectui#4858 had just retired from the guides.
 *
 * ## The "narrow" shape, inherited from `@object-ui/fields` (objectui#4059)
 *
 * A plugin's `src/index.css` `@reference`s components' entry: theme tokens, the
 * class-based `dark` variant and the animate plugin become available for
 * resolution while emitting nothing, and only the utilities layer is imported,
 * so there is no preflight and no `:root` theme block to begin with. This module
 * then subtracts every rule components' BUILT sheet already ships.
 *
 * The subtraction is not optional tidiness. `@reference` pulls in components'
 * own `@source` line, so the raw compilation of a plugin entry carries ~1350
 * utilities the consumer already has: 172 kB for `plugin-grid` before
 * subtraction, ~8 kB after. Without this step each plugin would publish a
 * near-complete copy of the components sheet.
 *
 * ## Why this is shared code
 *
 * `packages/fields/scripts/build-css.mjs` came first and is where all of the
 * reasoning above was worked out (objectui#4059); this module is its logic
 * generalised over `packageRoot`, because the ruling that ordered the plugin
 * sheets says "the build step is the pattern any future plugin inherits" and a
 * pattern that has to be copy-pasted is not inherited. Fields was re-pointed at
 * this module in objectui#6405, against a byte-for-byte check of its published
 * `dist/index.css` — so every package that ships a supplement sheet now runs
 * THIS subtraction, and a fix here reaches all of them.
 *
 * ## Failure modes this module refuses to have
 *
 * A subtraction that drops too much would silently ship an under-styled package
 * — the exact defect being fixed, wearing a green build. Four assertions run
 * BEFORE anything is written, and each throws rather than writing a wrong sheet:
 * every rule must be accounted for, the subtraction must have removed something,
 * the sheet may not grow past a leak ceiling, and the utilities only this build
 * can produce must still be present.
