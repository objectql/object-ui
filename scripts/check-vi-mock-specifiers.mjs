/**
 * Rejects a `vi.mock` / `vi.doMock` RELATIVE specifier that resolves to no file.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs
 *       node scripts/check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs --list   # every call site found
 *       node scripts/check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs --json
 * Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = an inert mock, or the population collapsed (see below)
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#5646)
 *
 * A module mock whose specifier names no file on disk does NOT error. Vitest
 * registers the mock against a module id that nothing imports, the run proceeds
 * with the REAL module everywhere, and the suite passes.
 *
 * That is the worst available failure direction. The test does not fail, does
 * not warn, and does not report fewer assertions -- it reports exactly the same
 * green a correct one does, so nothing in the output separates "this stand-in is
 * installed" from "this stand-in is inert".
 *
 * ## The instance this gate was built against
 *
 * PR #5645 added
 * `packages/app-shell/src/layout/__tests__/ChatDock.partialRuntimeConfig.test.tsx`,
 * which installs a deliberately partial runtime-config snapshot. The mock was
 * written one `..` short: it named the module as a sibling of the `layout/`
 * directory, where nothing of that name exists, instead of two levels up in
 * `src/` where it does.
 *
 * The suite passed. It also passed when the code under test was reverted to the
 * exact pre-fix shape the suite was written to catch -- a `TypeError` that, with
 * the mock actually installed, fails all four cases. Only an ablation leg
 * exposed it.
 *
 * The neighbours in that same file are what made it invisible to a reader: one
 * of them steps up ONE level and one steps up TWO, and BOTH are correct,
 * because their targets sit at different depths. A mock block is therefore a
 * plausible-looking mix of one-dot-dot and two, with nothing in it to say which
 * depth belongs to which line. That is also the discriminating case for this
 * gate: a resolver that got depth wrong would flag those two, and be deleted by
 * the first person it annoyed.
 *
 * ## The lineage
 *
 * objectui#4347 was `check-type-check-coverage.mjs` reporting green when a
 * `type-check` script chained a tsconfig project that does not exist -- a
 * declaration pointing at nothing, reported as a pass. This is the same shape
 * one layer down, at the module-mock level.
 *
 * ## Green at rest, and what follows from that
 *
 * There were ZERO unresolvable specifiers in this tree when this landed, and the
 * expectation is that there stay zero. So on any ordinary day this gate is
 * indistinguishable, from its output alone, from a gate that does nothing --
 * which is the very defect it exists to catch, one level up. Two consequences,
 * both load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **The population must refuse to collapse.** A walk that finds no source
 *      files, no test files, or no relative specifiers is not a clean tree; it
 *      is a broken walk, and reporting OK for it would be this card's defect
 *      wearing the gate's uniform. `FLOORS` below turn each of those into a
 *      failure. objectui#6195 landed the same discipline in a test as
 *      `expect(tracked.length).toBeGreaterThan(1000)`.
 *   2. **The verdict line carries the census**, not just "OK", so a reader can
 *      see the population the green was computed over.
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-vi-mock-specifiers.test.ts` carries the ablation --
 * the historical specifier reconstructed on a real fixture tree, and its two
 * correct neighbours -- because on this tree the run itself proves nothing.
 *
 * ## Scope: RELATIVE specifiers only (decided at dispatch, objectui#5646)
 *
 * A bare specifier (a package name, an alias) can be misspelled too, but
 * resolving one needs the workspace/package map rather than the filesystem -- a
 * different check with a different failure mode. Bare specifiers are COUNTED
 * here and reported in the census, never judged. Widening this gate into them is
 * a separate card, not an extension of this one.
 *
 * The `vi.mock(import(...))` form is matched by the same pattern, so it is
 * covered for free, and no handling was invented for it beyond that. The card
 * and the dispatch ruling both recorded its population as ZERO; re-measured on
 * this tree it is THREE, all of them in `registration`-style suites and all
 * naming a PACKAGE:
 *
 *     packages/plugin-kanban/src/registration.test.tsx:14
 *     packages/plugin-calendar/src/registration.test.tsx:31
 *     packages/plugin-list/src/__tests__/ListView.sharedGate.test.tsx:60
 *
 * What is zero is the intersection that matters here -- the form written with a
 * RELATIVE specifier, which is the set this gate judges. The census counts the
 * form separately so that stays visible rather than being inferred from a green.
 *
 * ## Why the walk is not restricted to test-NAMED files
 *
 * The obvious population is the `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` naming. It has a hole,
 * measured on this tree: THREE files carrying a real call site match no such
 * suffix, and TWO of those match no test-file naming convention at all, not even
 * a `__tests__/` directory --
 *
 *     apps/console/dev/__tests__/setup/common-mocks.ts   (suffix: no, dir: yes)
 *     packages/plugin-map/vitest.setup.ts                (neither)
 *     vitest.setup.base.ts                               (neither)
 *
 * A setup file is exactly where a repo-wide mock gets written, and a mock helper
 * shared by a directory of suites is exactly where one goes unreviewed. So the
 * walk takes every tracked JS/TS-family source file and lets the PATTERN decide
 * what is a call site. The test-named count is still derived and reported, as a
 * census figure and as its own floor, but it does not narrow the scan.
 *
 * ## Resolution mirrors how this repo really spells specifiers
 *
 * More than an existence check on the literal path, or the gate reddens on
 * hundreds of correct call sites:
 *
 *   - the bare path itself, plus each of `SOURCE_EXTENSIONS`;
 *   - the `<path>/index.<ext>` forms, for a directory specifier;
 *   - and a trailing `.js` / `.jsx` / `.mjs` / `.cjs` STRIPPED and the whole
 *     ladder retried on the stem, because `src/` is NodeNext throughout and
 *     `./x.js` is how a `./x.ts` is named there.
 *
 * The judgement is `isFile`, never a bare existence test: a specifier naming a
 * DIRECTORY is not resolved by that directory existing -- it is resolved by an
 * index file inside it, which the ladder covers explicitly.
 *
 * ## Only text the language would EXECUTE is judged
 *
 * A mock call has to be real source before it can be an inert mock, and there
 * are two ways for matching text not to be. Both are answered by one pass of the
 * shared `js-comment-mask.mjs` scanner, which is the repo's single answer to "is
 * this span comment, literal, or code":
 *
 *   - **comments are blanked.** A commented-out mock is not executed, so it
 *     cannot be inert, and flagging one fabricates a finding. This file's own
 *     header quotes the defect, so without the mask the gate reds on its own
 *     prose.
 *   - **a match whose call token is inside a literal is counted, not judged.**
 *     That is a code SAMPLE, not a call -- see `findCallSites` for the instance
 *     that made the distinction necessary and why the token, not the specifier,
 *     is the discriminator.
 *
 * String CONTENT is deliberately left intact through all of this -- a gate whose
 * signal IS a quoted specifier cannot afford to erase quoted text. The
 * consequence lands on this gate's own test suite, which has to build call-site
 * fixtures without writing a matchable one into its own source; it says so where
 * it does it.

 * not exist and must not -- an ESLint fixture is source text, never something
 * vitest loads, so the specifier has no directory to be relative to and no mock
 * to be inert.
 *
 * The discriminator is exactly the one the language uses: the `vi` TOKEN has to
 * be code. `scanSource` flags a literal's content, so a call written in source
 * has its token unflagged while its specifier is flagged, and a call quoted
 * inside a sample has both flagged. Nothing about the specifier separates them.
 *
 * These are COUNTED, not silently dropped -- an exclusion nobody can see in the
 * census is how a scan narrows itself into vacuity.
 *

 * is not a hole worth closing: vitest hoists mock calls out of MODULE SOURCE, so
 * a call assembled inside a template is not one it would ever register either.
