 * check-shell-escape-residue -- rejects a known MACHINE-PRODUCED shell-quote
 * escape run that has leaked into a fenced code block in agent-facing markdown.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-shell-escape-residue.mjs          (pnpm check:shell-escape-residue)
 *   node scripts/check-shell-escape-residue.mjs --list   every fence the walk examined
 *   node scripts/check-shell-escape-residue.mjs --json
 *
 * Exit: 0 = no enumerated residue inside a fenced block, and the population did
 *       not collapse. 1 = one of those.
 *
 * ## ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT DO -- read this before citing it as coverage
 *
 * It checks ONE ENUMERATED LITERAL (`RESIDUE_PATTERNS`, currently a single
 * entry) inside fenced blocks in five roots. That is the whole of it.
 *
 *   ⛔ It does NOT make fenced shell examples executable-by-construction, and
 *      nothing in this repository does. A ```bash block may be syntactically
 *      invalid, may never terminate, may reference a flag that does not exist,
 *      may `rm -rf` the wrong path -- this gate is green on every one of them.
 *      EXECUTABILITY IS UNGUARDED. `scripts/__tests__/check-shell-escape-residue.test.ts`
 *      asserts that as a FACT rather than as a sentence in this header: it feeds
 *      the gate a fence carrying an unterminated heredoc and a broken `if`, and
 *      requires a PASS.
 *
 *   ⛔ The unbuilt option is objectui#5151's "direction 1": run `bash -n` over
 *      every ```bash / ```sh block. It was ruled out of this card, not rejected
 *      on the merits, and it carries a dependency worth recording so nobody
 *      re-proposes it blindly -- IT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS EXTRACTION
 *      CONVENTION. In objectui#5150's own example the block sits inside a
 *      numbered list, so in the raw file both lines carry a two-space indent,
 *      and a heredoc opened `<<` + a quoted terminator requires that terminator
 *      at COLUMN 0. Rendered markdown strips the container indent and the block
 *      looks fine. ⭐ Agents read these files by `cat`, not by rendering them,
 *      so a verbatim copy INCLUDING the indent hangs in exactly the way the
 *      original defect did. Whether `bash -n` catches that depends entirely on
 *      whether the extractor dedents first -- so if direction 1 is ever built,
 *      decide and STATE what the extractor does with container indentation, and
 *      pick the answer matching how the file is actually consumed.
 *
 *   ⛔ It does not judge text OUTSIDE a fenced block. See "The one deliberate
 *      narrowing" below; the census counts those occurrences so the exclusion is
 *      a number rather than a silence.
 *
 *   ⛔ It does not look outside `SCAN_ROOTS`.
 *
 * The name is chosen to say all of that: `shell-escape-residue`, not
 * `shell-examples`. A gate named for a general property while checking a literal
 * list is how "no gate covers this" becomes "a gate covers this" in someone's
 * head a month later (objectui#5151 triage, made binding at dispatch).
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#5150, fixed by PR #5152; the class is objectui#5151)
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` §9 recommends `git commit -F -` with a heredoc. The line landed as
 * the heredoc introducer with its `EOF` wrapped in the single-quote-inside-
 * single-quote shell escape -- five characters, all printable ASCII. Copied
 * verbatim it opens a heredoc whose terminator is not `EOF`, so the closing line
 * never matches.
 *
 * Two amplifiers, and the card's weight is both of them together:
 *
 *   1. **There is no error to look at.** It does not exit with a message. It
 *      HANGS. A reader will not attribute a hung terminal to the document, and
 *      will fall back to exactly the workaround the clause argues against.
 *   2. **Agent-facing text is re-read once per session.** `AGENTS.md`,
 *      `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/**` and `.claude/skills/**` are inputs to every
 *      seat, so a bad example is not paid once -- it is paid by every reader.
 *      Those are also where this repository does most of its shell
 *      demonstrating. ⭐ The contributor tree under `.claude/skills/**` is on
 *      this surface for exactly that reason and no other (objectui#7403): it is
 *      not published, but it is agent-WRITTEN and agent-READ, which is both
 *      halves of the generating mechanism below.
 *
 * And the GENERATING MECHANISM IS FIXED AND REPRODUCIBLE: an agent writing a
 * file through a shell heredoc that is itself nested inside a single-quoted
 * argument leaks that escape run into the content. Neither side guarded it --
 * not the producing side, not the checking side.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and why a gate rather than a note (objectui#5151)
 *
 * The broken bytes were re-planted on the fix branch and the FULL derived gate
 * union for a change to `AGENTS.md` was run against them:
 *
 *     check-control-bytes       exit 0   -- judges control bytes; 0x27 and 0x22
 *                                          are printable, so out of set BY DESIGN
 *     check-doc-links           exit 0   -- has AGENTS.md in scope, but parses
 *                                          LINKS; block contents are not read
 *     check-changeset-presence  exit 0   -- judges declarations, never content
 *     check-changeset-no-major  exit 0   -- likewise
 *
 * All green. Not one of them was negligent: the residue is printable ASCII in a
 * code block, and no scan surface in this repository reached it. That is the
 * hole, and this file is the narrow half of it.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ GREEN AT REST -- so the ablation is the only evidence this gate exists
 *
 * There were ZERO occurrences in the tree when this landed (PR #5152 removed the
 * only one) and there should stay zero. A green run over today's tree therefore
 * proves only that today's tree is clean; it cannot distinguish a working gate
 * from one matching nothing at all -- which is objectui#5151's own defect, one
 * level up. Two consequences, both load-bearing and both copied deliberately
 * from `check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs` (objectui#5646), which is green at rest
 * for the same reason:
 *
 *   1. **The population must refuse to collapse.** Zero roots resolved, zero
 *      files scanned, or a fence count under `FENCE_FLOOR` is not a clean tree;
 *      it is a broken walk, and reporting OK for it would be this card's defect
 *      wearing the gate's uniform. Each is a FAILURE.
 *   2. **⚠️ A root that does not exist is LOUD, never a silent zero.** A
 *      mistyped root and a clean root produce identical output otherwise, and
 *      the mistyped one reads as coverage forever. `SCAN_ROOTS` declares each
 *      root's `kind`, so a root that vanished, moved, or turned from a file into
 *      a directory is reported by name and separately from an ordinary finding.
 *   3. **The verdict line carries the census** -- files and fences PER ROOT --
 *      so a reader sees the population the green was computed over.
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-shell-escape-residue.test.ts` carries the ablation:
 * objectui#5150's exact shipped line, reconstructed on a fixture tree.
 *
 * ## The enumeration, and why it has exactly one member
 *
 * `RESIDUE_PATTERNS` is a list of literals OBSERVED to be produced by a machine
 * and shipped. It has one entry because exactly one has been observed. ⛔ Adding
 * a second requires an observed instance, not a plausible one: the entire value
 * of this direction over direction 1 is that its false-positive rate is zero,
 * and the first speculative entry spends that.
 *
 * The measured population of the current entry across the four roots, at the
 * commit this landed on, is ZERO inside fences and ZERO outside them. Still
 * ZERO on both counts across five roots when objectui#7403 added
 * `.claude/skills` -- 20 fences in 4 files arrived clean.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The literal is legitimate shell -- so the claim here is narrower
 *
 * `'` + `"` + `'` + `"` + `'` is the standard way to put a literal single quote
 * inside a single-quoted string, and a hand-written one-liner may use it
 * correctly. This gate does not claim otherwise. It claims something smaller and
 * checkable: in THESE ROOTS the sequence has never once been intentional, and
 * every occurrence so far was a write-path leak.
 *
 * If a deliberate instance is ever genuinely needed in a documented example, the
 * equivalent `'\''` spelling is not matched here and is the documented remedy.
 * ⛔ There is deliberately no allowlist, baseline or inline opt-out: with a
 * measured population of zero, a permit mechanism would be the only thing in
 * this file anyone ever reached for.
 *
 * ## The one deliberate narrowing: fenced blocks only
 *
 * Occurrences are JUDGED inside a fenced code block and COUNTED everywhere else,
 * with the outside-fence count reported in the census. The reason is that prose
 * about this defect class has to be able to NAME the literal -- objectui#5151's
 * own body does, and a future `AGENTS.md` clause documenting this very gate
 * would too -- and no mechanical rule separates "quoting the residue" from
 * "shipping it" in running text.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a known gap, not a claim of completeness: residue inside an INLINE
 * code span is just as copy-pasteable and is NOT judged here. The census figure
 * is what keeps that visible -- a non-zero `outsideFences` is a number a reader
 * can act on. An exclusion nobody can see in the census is how a scan narrows
 * itself into vacuity.
 *
 * ## One fence walker, not a second copy
 *
 * `scanFences` is imported from `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` rather than
 * re-implemented. Fence scanning is already this repository's answer to "where
 * does a code block start and end", it is pinned by that gate's own test, and
 * objectui#3261/#3279 are the standing lesson that a second copy of one fact is
 * a second answer that drifts. It costs nothing: that module's whole import
 * graph is node builtins plus `./invoked-as.mjs`, so this gate stays in the
 * cheap pre-install tier that `check-pre-install-import-graph.mjs` enforces.

 * `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/**`, `content/docs/**`; widened to
 * `.claude/skills/**` by objectui#7403, for the reason recorded below.
 *
 * `kind` and `minFiles` exist for the "loud, never a silent zero" rule above.
 * `minFiles` is a COLLAPSE floor set with room, not today's count: the point is
 * to catch a walk that broke, not to pin figures that move every day. Measured
 * when this landed: 1 / 1 / 18 / 184 files, 12 / 2 / 235 / 1056 fences.
 *
 * ## ⭐ objectui#7403 -- a per-root floor measures the roots that are DECLARED,
 * never the tree that walked out of them
 *
 * objectui#7251 moved two contributor guides from `skills/objectui/` into
 * `.claude/skills/objectui-contributor/`. No row reached the new location, so 18
 * fenced blocks left this gate's surface in one commit and NOTHING WENT RED: the
 * `skills` row carries `minFiles: 5` and 16 files stayed behind it, so the floor
 * was satisfied by the tree that REMAINED while the tree that LEFT went
 * unmeasured. A floor is a collapse detector, not a coverage detector, and no
 * floor can be made to do the second job -- the only thing that catches a move
 * is declaring the new location, which is why a move and its `SCAN_ROOTS` row
 * belong in one change (the unresolved-root text in `main()` says the same for a
 * root that vanishes; this is its blind side). The sibling gate
 * `check-skills-paths.mjs` lost 55 stated paths to the same move and was widened
 * the same way in objectui#7358.
 *
 * Measured for the widening (objectui#7403, `6aeba67`): 4 files, 20 fences under
 * `.claude/skills` --
 * `objectui-contributor/guides/console-development.md` 9,
 * `objectui-contributor/rules/no-touch-zones.md` 9, `verify/SKILL.md` 2,
 * `objectui-contributor/SKILL.md` 0. The first two carry the 18 blocks
 * objectui#7251 moved; the other two had never been on this surface at all. All
 * four arrived with zero residue, inside fences and outside them.
 *
 * ⛔ `minFiles: 3` for that row -- PER ROOT, never a whole-surface floor, which
 * is the shape that failed: on a day this four-file root reads ZERO the other
 * four roots still return 203 of today's 207 files, so any total floor is green
 * through the whole outage. Seeded the way the others were, under today's count
 * with room for ordinary movement, and still red for the shape that caused this
 * card -- the `objectui-contributor` tree leaving reads 1, the two guides alone
 * leaving reads 2.
 *
 * ⚠️ The row is `.claude/skills`, not `.claude` -- and the difference is only
 * about files that do not exist yet. Every `.md`/`.mdx` under `.claude/` today
 * is under `.claude/skills/` (4 of 4), so the two specs read the same tree; the
 * narrower one was declared because it is the subtree whose contents are
 * agent-read prose by construction. ⛔ It therefore does NOT reach a future
 * `.claude/agents/*.md` or `.claude/commands/*.md` -- which is this card's own
 * class one step out, and is objectui#7413 rather than pre-solved here.
 *
 * ⚠️ `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/**` and `.claude/**` are GOVERNED SURFACE
 * (AGENTS.md §受管面). This gate READS them and never writes: a finding in one of
 * those is reported for a human to act on, and fixing it is a separate,
 * human-merged change. That is a property of the remedy, not of the scan.
