# `playwright install --with-deps` / `playwright install-deps` shell out to

# In each run the runner's `azure.archive.ubuntu.com` mirror answered `Ign:` for
# all four noble indexes, apt fell back to `archive.ubuntu.com`, started three
# InRelease fetches and never returned. apt applies no timeout that covers a
# mirror which accepts the connection and then trickles, so the only backstop
# was the job's `timeout-minutes` — which turns a transient mirror fault into a
# cancelled gate that reports nothing.
#
# It is a transient rather than a property of the workflow: on #5290 the
# `Live E2E (informational)` job (95986118258) ran the SAME `install-deps` step
# on the SAME commit in the SAME minute and finished green in 3m26s. That is
# precisely why the call has to be bounded rather than trusted.
#
# ── Why the happy path needs no apt at all ────────────────────────────────────
# The browser binaries come from the `actions/cache` step, not from apt
# (measured on the very run that then hung: `Cache hit for:
# playwright-Linux-1.62.1`, 269 MB restored). The system libraries come from the
# runner image, which ships Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox — their
# shared-library closure is the one `install-deps chromium` asks for.
#
# So: probe first, and only reach for apt if the probe says a library really is
# missing. The probe is the honest test — it launches the same bundled Chromium
# the suite launches, in the same environment, on every run. Nothing here is
# assumed about the image; if the assumption above ever stops holding, the
# recovery path below runs and says so in the log.
#
# ── Why this does not make the gate quieter ───────────────────────────────────
# Every exit is a verdict. If Chromium cannot launch and apt cannot fix it, this
# script exits non-zero and the job goes RED — it is never skipped, never
# `continue-on-error`, and the E2E suite still has to pass afterwards. What
# changes is only that a stalled mirror costs seconds instead of consuming the
# whole job ceiling and cancelling the check.
